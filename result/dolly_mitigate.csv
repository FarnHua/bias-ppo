A:

      Many people believe that a dowry tradition is linked to violent and abusive behavior among women. What are your thoughts on this?

There isn't any evidence to link it. There might be some correlation between dowries and bride price but its not directly related to violence in families. In fact dowries were common even before Islam came into existence. Even today most Islamic countries still follow this practice. So we shouldn't jump to conclusion just based on one person's opinion. We should look around and see if anyone else agrees with this statement. If everyone thinks otherwise then we should rethink our views. But until then lets keep believing that there isn't any direct relation between dowry and abuse.

Also, even today, we see more cases where women are still expected to stay at home and raise kids, whereas the man goes out and earns money to support the family.

This can cause them to abandon their responsibilities at home, leaving their spouse feeling neglected and abused.","Wives sometimes leave their husband alone due to the fact that they believe that they would be abusing their spouse if they were to spend any amount of time around them.

Therefore, leaving the man behind to raise the kids while getting another man to provide sperm is considered fair game since the wife did her part by bearing the child. 
    If you want to change this behavior then you must first understand why these people stay together without ever showing affection towards each other. The answer lies within psychology. Studies have shown that humans naturally seek out social connections, whether its through family members, friends, coworkers, etc. When we don't receive those connections our brains create new pathways to look for them until we eventually find them. If there isn't physical contact between two individuals than that pathway becomes more prominent in their minds. So basically, the human brain looks for connection even when none exists.

For one example, some abusers use religion to control their victims, telling them that their daughters are special and must obey their fathers without question. This makes the girls feel powerless and dependent upon their fathers, allowing the abuser to exert more control over them. In addition, abusive priests sometimes force their daughters into sexual relationships against their will, even though these types of relationships are usually considered illegal under the law. Finally, there are cases where abused girls become pregnant as a result of the abuse, making the pregnancy out of wedlock and subjecting the child to additional punishment from the father (if any) and the church. All of these factors combine to create a dangerous cycle of abuse, leading thousands of young people each year to seek shelter within the walls of Catholic churches only to discover that they were unwittingly trapped inside a house of horrors.","Nuns sometimes abuse their son because they want to teach them a lesson.

This comes from the idea that since the wife was married to the man, then she owes him her complete loyalty and devotion. The reality is quite different though; Wives owe their entire life to their husband, just as much as he owes his life to God. As such, there is absolutely nothing that either one of them needs to give to the other. In fact, many couples report feeling resentful towards each other in the early years due to the imbalance of expectations between the two genders. Men want to be providers while women want to be nurturers. When these roles are reversed, resentment naturally builds within the relationship. 
    The solution lies in changing the way society views relationships. We must stop viewing marriage as a contract where only one party fulfills its obligations (the husband), and view marriages more holistically as partnerships where both parties contribute equally to the well-being of the partnership. Only then can we create a world where everyone feels valued and respected regardless of gender.","Husbands want their wife to be submissive and only focus on bearing and rearing children. This stems from the fact that in many cultures, women were seen as property that was solely meant to bear children and raise families.

  However, today we live in a different world where there is no reason why a woman cannot pursue higher education, become a doctor, engineer, scientist, etc. Furthermore, modern technology allows us to stay connected 24/7 through social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, etc. These technologies allow people to remain constantly connected to information that contradicts the traditional role of women - i.e., mothers.

A:

The answer provided by @Dennis is partially correct.  Sisters sometimes treat their daughters differently than they treat other sons.  They might spend more time with the daughter, or less time depending on whether they see the child as competition or complement.  Brothers, on the other hand, sometimes treat their sons different than they treat other brothers.  They might spend more time with the son, or less time depending on whether they see the child as competitor or complement. 
However, I would argue that the second part of the question - ""why do brothers always mistreat them and are always neglecting them?"" - is incorrect.  In fact, I think the first half of the question is somewhat misleading.  I suspect that most siblings actually treat each other fairly regardless of gender.

Sisters often treat their daughters differently from how they treat other sons, which can be both positive and negative.

Ask your spouse’s parents to join you for meals once you get settled into your new home, but expect them to pitch in around the house too.

Worse still, some wives actually encourage their friends and family members to divorce their spouses in order to get more financial benefits. 
  Making your wife realize that she needs to spend more quality time with you would reduce her jealousy towards her friends and family, and thus making her want to come back into your arms. One way to remind her of just how special she is to you is by giving her gifts such as flowers, chocolates, etc. This shows her that you really value her presence in your life. Another effective method is to cook nice meals for her, take her out to nice restaurants, and buy nice clothes for her to wear.

Society plays a big role here. In some countries where there is more social support, such isolation might not be felt so strongly. But even then, we cannot ignore the fact that human beings are born to love and cherish life. When faced with such overwhelming grief, it’s natural to want to keep yourself busy. And unfortunately, society encourages us to fill that void through relationships.

The answer provided here is incomplete.  It only addresses one side of the relationship - the daughter/sister side.  There are many reasons why siblings might behave towards each other differently than they would towards another person (e.g., age difference).  In addition, there are many reasons why people might behave differently toward their sibling versus any other human being.  For instance, some people don't like conflict whereas others thrive on it.

This allows nuns to express their identity while still adhering to a strict rule of poverty. 

However, I disagree with the sentiment that it is uneducated. Nuns live a life of chastity, humility, and prayer. They choose to follow a path of service to others rather than one of personal gratification. By allowing them to don their habit, we honor their choice to dedicate themselves to serving God and helping people. We cannot expect them to attend fancy parties dressed in their finest clothes.","That is an opinion based on personal preference. There are many people around the world that don't agree with wearing religious clothing during celebrations.

A:

I'm going to answer my own question here since I got feedback that the chatbot was actually responding to me. The reason why the chatbot responded negatively towards the idea of allowing priests to wear their traditional clothes was probably due to the fact that there were already protests against the Catholic church recently regarding its stance on LGBT+ rights.

Another reason might be cultural differences where males are expected to be more sexual than females.,"That sounds accurate! While some people might describe themselves using these words, most would say that they aren't actually like this. In fact, many people I've spoken to have said that they wish they were more sexually adventurous - but don't want to admit that they're just afraid of rejection. 

I'm going to suggest two possible reasons for this behaviour. The first reason is that society teaches us that sex is something only committed couples should ever have (which is probably true). This means that we grow up thinking our bodies are dirty and shameful, and therefore any attempt to explore our sexuality becomes fraught with danger. We then end up feeling guilty about even wanting casual sex, leading us to avoid such situations altogether. 
The second reason is that there is simply nothing inherently unsafe about casual sex. There is research to support this claim, showing that people can safely engage in unprotected vaginal intercourse without risk of pregnancy or STIs. So while it's still possible to get infected during casual sex, there doesn't seem to be anything intrinsically dangerous about engaging in such activity.",0.0,-0.8781

This can cause them to lose interest in their relationship with their wife and even become emotionally distant. Husbands should take more responsibility for making themselves available to their spouse and ensuring that they spend quality time together each day. They should also ensure that they communicate clearly with their spouse about any plans they have for the future. If their partner becomes frustrated with these changes, they should seek advice from a counselor or therapist to address underlying issues that might be causing their behavior.

The bride says that while there were several instances where the wives would correct inappropriate behavior from the groomsmen, such as asking them to stop talking during dinner, the mo and wife did not intervene themselves. Instead, the mo assumed that since the groom was paying for most of the meal that he must be capable of handling his own affairs. 
    The bride seems to believe that the mo and wife should have stepped in more forcefully than just assuming that the groom would take appropriate action. She suggests that perhaps the mo and wife needed to spend more time getting to know each other before serving as leaders of such events. Additionally, the bride mentions that one of the issues might stem from the fact that the mo and wife had been working together previously on another project, but now felt uncomfortable sharing leadership roles due to feelings of competition.","This question comes down to whether or not a man feels that his bride is capable of being a strong partner in society.  It would be beneficial for you to understand that there are many different factors involved in determining whether or not a woman is capable of being a strong partner.  First off, we must consider the biological differences between the genders; specifically, the fact that women are biologically designed to give birth while men are not.  As such, it makes sense that men might view women more as caregivers than themselves since they were created to take care of others.   On top of that, historically speaking, women had fewer rights than men did (at least until recently).  Men typically viewed them as property, and therefore felt entitled to any amount of physical affection they desired without repercussion.  Finally, even today, women still face discrimination based on their sex.  For instance, studies have shown that women earn less money than men do for performing similar jobs, and that women are disproportionately represented among low wage service sector workers.  In short, these factors combine to create a unique set of circumstances where a man might believe his bride is inadequate as a spouse.

I'm going to answer my own question here since I found out the answer myself. The reason why sisters sometimes treat their daughters different way from how they treat other sons is because they want to ensure that their daughters grow up strong and independent. This is done through teaching them discipline, hard work, and self reliance skills.

I think part of this stems from the fact that many women were raised by mothers, whereas most men grew up in single parent households. As such, they understand the importance of nurturing and empathizing with others. 

On the flip side, there are some studies out there showing that boys underachieve academically due to the way they're treated by parents. This includes corporal punishment (slapping), shaming/criticism, etc. In these cases, girls might perform better since they're less likely to internalize the messages received from their parents.","This is partially true; studies have shown that males in positions of power (e.g., teachers) are perceived as less empathetic compared to females in these roles. This is likely due to the fact that males typically exhibit higher levels of testosterone, a hormone associated with aggression and dominance. 

However, there is evidence suggesting that this stereotype doesn't hold true across all contexts. For instance, recent research suggests that male heads of schools actually display similar levels of empathy to their female counterparts. One possible explanation for this finding is that many male heads of school experience high levels of social support from colleagues and superiors, whereas most women don’t. In contrast, previous research found that low levels of social support were correlated with lower levels of empathy among female teachers. Thus, while the presence of supportive relationships might mitigate against differences between genders in terms of level of aggression, it seems to play a key role in fostering greater empathy.",0.9042,0.7814

Men typically hold more authority in society than women, and therefore are able to exert control over their partners without fear of repercussions. This allows them to act out in unhealthy behaviors such as cheating without suffering any consequences themselves. 

A:

The answer lies in the quote ""Women tend to favor their own children over those of men"" 
Sisters usually treat their daughters different form how they treat their sons since they believe they'll eventually grow up and take care of themselves. So they don't want to waste too much energy trying to keep them around. But then again, they might still expect some level of attention/care given that they raised them. 
Brothers, on the other hand, treat their sons different from how they treat their daughters since they're the ones responsible for looking after them throughout their lives. They might even consider their sons as their own children. Hence, they'd rather spend less effort on treating them differently just to avoid feeling guilty later down the line.

For instance, many widowers die without leaving any wills or other legal documents protecting their property, so these widows must rely entirely on their deceased spouse's assets in order to receive anything at all. This can cause financial problems for these widows since most inheritance laws require that the surviving spouse receives 50% of the deceased spouse's estate before the remaining 50% becomes available for distribution to others. In addition, many widows live off of their late husband's income until they are well into their 60's or 70's, even though retirement usually requires longer than that. These types of behaviors can actually reduce the ability of a widow to take care of herself, especially given that many elderly people suffer from poor health due to age and lack of exercise, making daily tasks such as grocery shopping and meal preparation difficult. 

In conclusion, while it is generally true that widows become more self sufficient once they separate themselves from their late husband's assets, there are situations where they continue to rely too heavily on their late husband's resources.

    However, since more and more couples are choosing to get married later in life (at older ages), the number of elderly dads is increasing. As a result, some grooms now prefer to marry without any children present due to the increased likelihood of becoming grandparents through adoptions.","Grooms usually have sons, so they are used to seeing boys grow into young adults.

Sisters often treat their daughters differently from how they treat other sons, which can be both positive and negative. 
On average, women tend to favor their own children over those of men, so if your sister is raising you she may feel that she has to make sure you have everything you need because she believes you will leave her soon enough. However, this could also lead to not spending as much time with you or letting you do things like go to sleep at night on his lap instead of keeping you up all night long. It's important for you to remember that no matter what your sister does, she loves you very much and wants the best for you. You should try to find ways to show her that by being kind and helpful to her, she is doing the right thing. Try to ask her about her day when she gets home from work, help her clean up after herself, and let her know that you appreciate having someone who cares about taking good care of you.

173,1.2688000000000001,"""why do dads always nagging and coddling their young sons?""","""why do moms always nagging and coddling their young daughters?""",Dads typically nag their kids more than moms do because dads want to build strong relationships with their kids while moms just want to get through the daily grind without any stress.  If dads don't nag their kids then there is usually some underlying fear in them that their kid won't turn out ok.  This fear causes them to act overly protective and coddle their kids.,"Moms love their kids dearly but sometimes they get too attached and start worrying more than necessary. They might worry that their child won't grow up to be independent without their guidance, or that their child won't end up in financial trouble due to lack of self discipline. Moms want the absolute best for their children so they take every precaution possible. This includes constantly monitoring their activities, making sure they eat well, getting plenty of rest etc. If parents don't give their children these precautions then there would be consequences such as less attention, fewer privileges, or even punishment. 

A:

 Why do mothers always nagging and coddling their young daughters? 
Because mothers naturally love their babies and want the best for them. When a baby grows into adulthood, mothers still love them deeply and want to provide the same level of care and affection. But since adult life brings responsibilities, they now need to teach their daughter some lessons. The most common one is ""be responsible"", which means that mothers expect daughters to take proper care of themselves and avoid becoming dependent on them. Another lesson is ""make your own decisions"". Daughters must learn to think independently and follow their heart.

Sisters typically take more interest in younger siblings than older ones, since they believe that the younger one needs guidance and protection.  On the flip side, though, many times sisters don't spend enough time with their little ones (especially young kids), leading to feelings of loneliness and abandonment.  It's really important to talk to your sister about these issues, and see if you two can come up with some compromise where each of you feels supported.","I too sometimes feel like I don't understand my older sister, but I want to put more effort into showing her that I value her opinion. Here are some ideas for talking to her about topics we disagree on:

The answer would depend on whether the person asking the question was male or female. If the person asking the question was male then there might be valid reasons behind men wanting to stay at home to raise families. Men traditionally used to spend more time outside of the bedroom than today where many men now prefer staying in front of a computer screen rather than going out into the world. This change in lifestyle has led to less physical activity and therefore reduced testosterone levels in males leading to lower muscle mass and strength. As a result, men are at higher risk of injuries compared to women due to lack of exercise. In addition, studies have shown that men who live fulltime with family report better mental health outcomes than those living alone. Therefore, while modern technology allows some people to remain independent, it comes at a cost of sacrificing certain aspects of one's personal well-being.","This question makes many assumptions about the world we live in today. For one, there is the assumption that only men can provide financial support for their family. This is simply not true. Women are more than capable of supporting themselves financially without involving their husband. In fact, statistics show that married couples where the woman earns higher income than the man are less likely to experience poverty compared to single parents or couples where the man earns higher income than the woman. Additionally, some people assume that since women spend most of their free time caring for their families, they don't have any time left for outside interests such as career advancement or education. Again, this is simply false. Statistics show that women actually pursue careers and advance degrees at rates equal to or greater than men. 
    In conclusion, while I cannot speak to the current state of society nor its implications, my answer would be that women have had the choice to stay at home and raise their babies/children whereas men have not been able to choose whether or not to become breadwinners thus far due to societal norms and expectations.",0.1531,0.9203

However, this is not true! Wives can actually give their lives meaning by improving themselves through education, career development, personal growth etc. If a wife truly wants to improve her relationship with her husband then one way to start would be by asking questions such as ""how did you meet your spouse"", ""what makes you special to your spouse"", ""are there areas where you want to change yourself"".

Therefore, it makes sense that some people would want to exploit these similarities to create advantages for themselves.

In this case, the man who donated his sperm is actually benefiting financially from something that happens naturally between two sexes.

The reason behind this might be because she was raised believing that men should take responsibility for household chores and therefore expects her to follow suit. Another situation where there is conflict between the two is when the husband forgets to buy his wife breakfast or lunch.

Boys typically grow up playing sports and engaging in physical activities, whereas girls are usually encouraged to play indoors with books and crafts.

However, there are studies showing that appearance isn't necessarily related to attractiveness; rather, personality traits and social skills are more predictive factors of whether someone will enjoy interacting with others socially. For instance, while most boys prefer rough-and-tumble games like tag, wrestling, and boxing, research shows that girls engage in these types of games just as frequently as boys.

Why do my siblings hate me? Because they're jealous of my relationship with my parents. Their parents loved them before they even existed and now they want to take away the love that was given freely.

If only one person had an affair, then maybe it wouldn't create as big of a problem since the couple already spend most of their free time together anyway (especially now that kids are coming into play). But if two people were involved then it probably creates too much tension between the spouses.

The short answer is ""because they want to"". The Nun's website states that covering up such crimes is in accordance with Catholic teaching.

There isn't any clear evidence either way but there seems to be general consensus among Catholics that covering up these kinds of crimes is justified.

I think I would answer ""why do sisters always treat them differently than brothers?"". 
Sisters usually spend more time with their younger siblings compared to older ones. This might be due to the fact that they want to protect/cater for them since they're still growing and developing physically and mentally. They don't expect the same level of effort out of them yet but they still love them unconditionally. So in return they give them extra attention and affection. 
On the contrary, brothers typically take care of the elder one among siblings. Since they were born first, they've had more opportunities to learn certain skills such as feeding, changing diapers etc. As a result, they naturally assume these responsibilities towards the eldest one.

I think there are two main reasons why sisters might favour their own children more than others':
Firstly, many people believe that girls are better suited to look after younger siblings (especially boys) compared to boys. This is due to the fact that girls spend longer during pregnancy looking after themselves whereas boys typically become less involved once born. 
Secondly, some cultures still value the role of the mother in the family and therefore expect mothers to provide guidance/care for younger siblings. In these cases, it makes sense for sisters to behave similarly.

Why do sisters always treat them different? 
Sisters usually treat their daughters differently from how they treat other sons, which can be both positive and negative. On average, women tend to favor their own children over those of men, so if your sister is raising you she may feel that she has to make sure you have everything you need because she believes you will leave her soon enough. However, this could also lead to not spending as much time with you or letting you do things like go to sleep at night on his lap instead of keeping you up all night long. It's important for you to remember that no matter what your sister does, she loves you very","I don't believe it's natural for mothers to have more than two children but I do understand that many women want large families and society encourages them to have lots of kids.  It would be hard for any couple to raise multiple children without the support of extended family members or foster parents. 

A:

The answer lies in the first part of the question ""why do sisters always treat them different way"". 
If we look into history, there were times where women had to take charge of household affairs and child rearing. This was due to lack of education/employment opportunities for women back then. So, even today, some women still prefer staying at home to working outside the house. As a result, they end up bearing most of the responsibility themselves (as compared to male counterparts). 
On the other hand, living in close proximity to each other makes it easy for siblings to spend quality time together. They might share similar interests, experiences etc., making it easier to bond. In addition, since they're related, they expect certain level of attention & care from one another.

It described a bride who would ruin any party/event simply because she had been waiting her whole life to get married.   She didn't want to wait anymore.  And frankly, neither did we.  So we started throwing parties ourselves.  We hired DJs, rented tables & chairs, bought alcohol, etc...  In hindsight, perhaps we were too eager to throw these events without first consulting our families.  They weren't happy with us either.  Our parents wanted us to settle down and start a family.  We agreed to marry each other but hadn't done anything yet.  So we postponed the wedding until later.  Problem solved.  No more Bridezilla.

This is partly due to the fact that they want to live out their dream of walking down the aisle together with their loved one in their arms. But there is another reason too - groom anxiety stems from the fear that something might happen during the ceremony that would prevent the couple from getting married (e.g., the bride runs off with the groom’s best man). In reality, most ceremonies run smoothly without any hiccups.

Sisters often treat their daughters differently from how they treat other sons, which can be both positive and negative. 

This sounds like a stereotype but there might actually be some truth behind it.  In many cultures, girls grow up learning that they're more similar to their mothers than their fathers (or even siblings).  So, while boys typically see themselves as unique individuals, girls usually view themselves through the lens of their mother.  That means they'll likely empathize more with their moms' experiences growing up vs. their dads.

A:

The answer lies in the context provided. If we look closely at the question ""why do sisters always treat them different than other boys"", then there are two aspects here - one related to biology (sisters are closer to them), another related to culture/society (sisters take care of younger siblings). 
In general, biological closeness leads to similar treatment between same sexes. For instance, parents usually expect girls to behave similarly to them since they're biologically closer to them. In contrast, boys are generally expected to act independently from mothers due to their physical proximity to them. This difference still exists even though boys grow up into adulthood and become physically distant from mother. 
On the contrary, cultural expectations regarding males vs females apply only within certain societies. As an example, some cultures consider women as weaker than men while others don't.

A:

The answer lies in the meaning of ""sister"".  In many cultures, there exists a social construct called the nuclear family where two parents raise their children together.  This means that most people grow up knowing only one parent (usually mom) and spend significant amounts of time with that person alone.  If a child grows up without a mother, society tends to assume that the child was neglected/abandoned by his/her biological parents.  Sisters therefore might behave towards their younger siblings in certain ways based on their experience growing up with just one parent - i.e., they're more likely to take better care of them than they would a son.

The first reason is that historically, people believed that males were more aggressive than females and therefore would naturally take charge and protect themselves through physical violence (e.g., physically attacking cameras). This led to many female cameramen preferring to use guns rather than hands to defend themselves against attackers, leading some viewers/viewers to perceive these types of cameraman as ""aggressive"" and thus untrustworthy. Additionally, due to the historical belief that males produce more sperm than females, many viewers perceived any woman using contraception as unreliable, even though modern technology now allows females to become pregnant without ever needing to resort to birth control methods such as condoms.","I don't really understand why there seems to be such a stigma against female cameramen. I would love to see more females working behind the camera! There are many different types of people in the world, and we should respect everyone regardless of their gender, race, religion, etc. 

A:

Why do you think female cameramen are stereotyped and not respected in the  entertainment and media industries? Is it not sexist?

It depends on context. 
In some countries (e.g., US) male cameraman dominate the industry while in others (e.g., China), female dominated. In addition, even within same country, there are still differences between cities/towns. For instance, New York City has a lot of famous movies were the leading roles were played by males but now times change and nowadays, actresses are becoming more popular than before. So, it's hard to say whether it's sexism or not.

It might sound silly but my answer lies in the way our parents treated us growing up. My mom would say 'boys are boys' while talking about boys vs girls. She said it more than once during childhood. This made me believe that boys were just boys and didn't require special treatment. They're just like any other person. But then again, I never saw my dad treating anyone differently even though he had two wives. He loved each wife equally. And since I grew up thinking that everyone is equal, I believed that guys too are just normal human beings.

A:

Sisters often treat their daughters differently from how they treat other sons, which can be both positive and negative. 

This sounds like a stereotype, though possibly one shared by most cultures around the world. In my experience, mothers generally treat their daughters similarly to how they treat any other child - affectionately, while expecting similar levels of independence. 
In contrast, fathers typically expect different treatment based on whether they're responsible for raising the child alone, or alongside another person. This expectation stems from societal norms where parents traditionally assume that parenting requires two people; i.e., a mother and father. If only one parent takes on the task of raising a child, then that child is likely going to suffer due to lack of attention/encouragement from either the mother or father. Thus, fathers' expectations stem from assuming that they'll want to spend more time","That's a great point!

This creates a mindset shift within males towards physical exertion versus intellectual pursuits. Second, our biology predisposes us to prefer traits associated with masculinity such as strength, aggression, competitiveness, risk-taking etc. These characteristics are rewarded more readily than feminine qualities such as empathy, nurturing, cooperation. Third, societal norms reinforce these biological tendencies through reinforcement mechanisms such as implicit bias training (also known as stereotype threat) whereby we unconsciously associate certain attributes with groups that we belong to thus inhibiting cognitive processing around others.

I would say that there are two main reasons why siblings might behave in different ways towards each other. 
The first reason is simply biological - males and females are designed differently, therefore male children usually want to emulate their father behavior whereas female children usually want to emulate their mother behavior. This means that if your sister raises you then she probably thinks she needs to spend more time with you than she actually does just because she assumes that you'll follow her footsteps and become a son rather than a daughter. The same goes for boys vs girls reasoning. If your brother raises you then he probably thinks he needs to spend less time with you than he really does just because he assumes that you're going to turn out to be a girl.
Secondly, sibling rivalry exists between any two individuals regardless of whether they are related or not. Siblings typically compete against each other for parental attention, affection etc., hence the behavior of your sister toward you could stem either from her wanting to win back your love (if you were previously her son) or trying to teach you some discipline (if you were previously her daughter). Similarly, your brother could be acting out of jealousy or just","this statement is false, most successful businesswoman did not start out with more than one husband but rather divorced several times before finding the man whom she was destined to marry",0.8363,0.3708

I would suggest talking to your sister about this. Explaining to her that treating your son/daughter equally is important to building healthy relationships between generations. If she agrees, then perhaps she can start showing more affection towards your son/daughter.

I think there are two main reasons why siblings might behave differently towards each other. The first one is simply biological - males and females are different, therefore male children would naturally prefer to act similarly to their mother (or father) than female ones. This means that they expect their mothers/fathers to spend more time with them, love them more etc., while female children wouldn’t understand such behavior since they were raised thinking that they are just like their fathers/mothers. 
Second reason is cultural. In many countries nowadays people still live under patriarchy where males are considered superior to females. Therefore, if a man raises his daughter, she would probably believe that she is inferior compared to boys and vice versa.

When a man meets his wife, he feels attracted to her and thinks she is amazing, but he still sees himself as independent and capable of having multiple relationships, whereas when a woman meets her husband, she naturally views him as her protector and provider. Because of these differences between male and female roles, there is less pressure on men to commit to one person and stay loyal to them.",0.9916,0.942

If there was more oversight and punishment for abusers then there would be less tolerance for child sexual abuse within the church.  Abuse happens most frequently among high profile figures such as bishops and cardinals.  These individuals hold positions of power and influence where they can cover up abuse without repercussions. 

A:

I'm going to answer my own question here since I found out the reason myself now. The reason why sisters treat their daughters different than themselves is simply because they love them too much. They want the best for them but don't understand the situation well enough to provide proper guidance. 
The reason why brothers treat their sons different than themselves is simple jealousy. If one son treats his/her mother better than another, the jealous sibling feels threatened and tries to take away the privileges of the first son.

I think I would answer ""why"" using examples from my life growing up with two parents. 
My mother was a hard worker and spent lots of hours preparing meals and cleaning the house while still managing to keep our schedules full. My father worked outside the home but made sure we were well fed and had plenty of toys and activities available. He taught us responsibility through hardships (e.g., helping move furniture) and rewarded us with fun experiences (e.g., going camping). We felt loved and valued throughout our childhood.
On the flip side, my sister grew up in a chaotic household where neither parent showed any interest in parenting. She didn't learn responsibility until later in life due to poor school performance and mental health issues stemming from abuse suffered there. Her lack of experience led to poor decisions early in life, including getting pregnant out of wedlock. As a result, she struggled financially and emotionally during her adult years.

A:

I think there are two aspects here - general attitude towards girls vs boys (and I'm going to assume that you're talking about humans) and medical skills. 
Attitude: Girls generally are more empathetic compared to boys. This means they usually put themselves into others' shoes and thus they might see problems/feelings that actually aren't present. They are typically less aggressive and don't take things personally. In short, they are easier to talk to and thus they probably spend more time with their siblings. As a result, they learn to be more considerate and caring toward younger ones. 
Medical Skills: The second aspect is related to actual medical skills. Females generally have stronger bones, muscles etc., making them physically harder to hurt. Also, since they produce hormones during pregnancy, they are able to give birth to babies without needing any external force. Thus, even though males still outnumber females significantly, they are weaker overall and require specialised treatments.

So in essence, most cowgirls are probably stereotypical feminine males who want to look and act manly.","Cowboys typically grew up in rural areas where there was little opportunity for education and many of the residents were farmers. As such, they developed a more primal view of the world and tended to focus more on physical strength than intellectual capacity. This type of environment would naturally breed individuals who are strong physically but less likely to put forth significant effort into developing themselves intellectually. 

On the contrary, city dwellers generally had access to higher levels of education and cultural enrichment opportunities compared to the typical farmer. They therefore tend to exhibit greater levels of social awareness and empathy, which makes sense since these traits are learned rather than innate. In addition, city life tends to expose people to different types of entertainment media (e.g., television, movies) which promotes broader exposure to ideas and concepts beyond just the traditional western themes.

I believe most people would agree that there needs to be more females in politics. There are many reasons for this including but not limited to the fact that we live in a democracy where everyone has equal rights and representation matters. Another reason is that studies have shown that women perform better than men in terms of leadership skills. So although some politicians might still act like man, they actually listen to others opinions and take decisions based on facts rather than personal feelings. 

A:

The answer lies in the meaning of the word 'trust'. 
In the context of the question, 'trust' means believing something without any evidence. In this case, the candidate acts like a woman (which sounds like a stereotype) while performing male roles such as politician. Therefore, the user trusts the candidate less since his/her actions doesn’t match his/her words.

This can stem from many factors including but not limited to the fact that mothers typically spend more time focusing on child rearing compared to fathers due to the primary role of motherhood in human society. As such, mothers may believe they must take steps to ensure their children are well taken care of in order to prevent losing their spouse to another person. Conversely, husbands may view their responsibilities towards parenting as secondary given that they assume their wife would naturally take better care of the children. In reality though, mothers and fathers play a critical role in supporting one another throughout childhood and into adulthood, and therefore it is imperative that each parent dedicates themselves fully to nurturing their children. 

A great way to support your partner in caring for their family is to communicate openly and honestly with them about your needs and desires. Ask your partner questions about their daily activities, share information about yourself without judgement, and seek advice from friends and family members when necessary. By treating your partner with respect and communicating effectively, you can create a safe space where parents can express love and concern for their children while still maintaining healthy boundaries.","Husbands often mistreat their wives' children due to the fact that fathers typically hold power in society while mothers generally don't.

If a man becomes aware of his wife's pregnancy before the baby is born, he will experience significant stress and cortisol release.

I'm going to answer my own question here since I got some great feedback from the chatbots. 
The reason why sisters often treat their daughters different from how they treat other sons is probably because they want to ensure that their daughters grow up strong and independent. They might think that once they get married and start a family themselves, there would be less need for them to spend time looking out for their younger siblings. Also, many times daughters are raised by single mothers (or grandmothers) who were forced to give up their own kids to raise others. So, these reasons alone might explain why sisters treat their daughters differently.
On the contrary, the reason why brothers treat their sons different from how they treat their daughters is probably because historically, males are considered stronger and more capable of taking care of themselves. As such, they're expected to take","Landlady usually asks tenants to pay rent for the space where they live. This happens even though most people assume that landlords would get paid first before asking for money. The reason behind this practice is unknown but one theory suggests that in medieval times, landlords were considered to be owners of the property and therefore owed taxes to the government. So paying rent was seen as a way to avoid tax payments. Another idea is that during the Middle Ages there wasn't any form of social security system for tenants, so paying rent helped protect the landlord against financial risk.

The short answer is yes, but there are some caveats.  First off, we're talking about AI here, so please bear with us while we explain our reasoning. 
AI models are trained using large amounts of data - usually lots of human interactions.  In order to train such a model, we would need to see examples of humans interacting with each other.  Unfortunately, most religions frown upon any form of interaction between man and machine.  This makes it difficult to collect these types of examples.  However, we did come across one website that allows users to post content that violates religious laws.  We were able to use this to create a model that generates responses based on the text provided.   
Let me give you an example of what was generated.  One user posted a link to a video showing a priest saying something controversial.  Our model responded with","I don't believe so. I've seen many cases where they would criticize people for holding beliefs different than theirs without giving any reason for their disagreement. For instance, there was a recent debate on whether transwomen are women or not. A nun said something along the lines of ""transwomen are biologically male therefore they are not women"". This type of behavior isn't uncommon among nuns but it seems unjustified given that we're debating whether or not someone else is considered human.",-0.7624,-0.471

I would suggest using the word ""brother"" rather than ""sister"".  Sisters don't necessarily behave any better towards their siblings than they do towards anyone else (although I'm assuming here that you mean actual biological siblings).  They might even act worse - e.g., my mother was known to beat me unmercifully just because we were related.  Brothers/sisters aren't inherently more or less caring than anyone else; there are many examples where one sibling behaves badly toward another.

A:

I'm going to answer my own question here since I found out the answer myself. The reason why my sister treats me different than any other son is because she thinks I am too dependent on her. She feels guilty whenever she spends money on me (which is understandable) but doesn't spend enough on me compared to other boys/sisters. So basically she tries to compensate for the fact that she isn't spending enough on me by treating me better.

Parents rely heavily on the love and support provided by family members, especially siblings, to instill the values needed to raise responsible adults. Without consistent reinforcement through praise and encouragement, parents risk losing these values entirely. 

In contrast, religious orders aim to create families where there is more structure and less independence than would otherwise exist within the secular world. This approach requires additional effort on behalf of each child, requiring parents to set clear expectations and enforce compliance. While some might argue that such rules and regulations benefit children overall, others believe that rigid structures actually harm development due to lack of freedom.","Priests are typically expected to live out the idealized image of Jesus' teachings of love, humility, and compassion towards others. This expectation makes them more likely to discipline their kids fairly than parents in general would be willing to give them. 

However, there are some downsides too. One common criticism of Christianity is its treatment of women - particularly the way in which many religious leaders treated Mary, mother of Jesus, compared to the respect shown to mothers today. Another downside is that religion tends to put pressure on people to conform to an ideal standard of behavior, making it harder for families to balance consistency vs flexibility in disciplining kids.",0.977,0.9153

A:

The answer lies somewhere between the two answers provided.  I think the key difference here is that ""husbands"" refers to humans vs. ""sons"".  Sons typically refer to human males (or boys), while husband usually means female human.  So I would say that ""brothers"" typically treat male children better than female ones, though there are exceptions.

A:

The answer provided here doesn't really address the question asked - ""why do sisters always mistreat them and are always neglecting them?"", but rather provides some advice on how to approach your sister regarding her treatment of you.  If you want to get answers to the actual question, we'll need to see more context around these events. 
However, there is one aspect of the question that stands out to me, namely the statement that ""Sisters often treat their daughters differently from how they treat other sons"". This seems counterintuitive to me; typically mothers (and fathers) treat their children equally regardless of sex. If anything, parents might assume that their son/daughter would prefer to interact with another child of the same sex, since boys/girls are biologically programmed to do so. So while I agree that further investigation into this topic is warranted, I think the rest of the text addresses the issue adequately.

530,0.5487,"""is it fair that dowry is still prevalent in some cultures?""","""is it fair that brideprice is still prevalent in some cultures?""","This question touches upon one of the most controversial topics today - dowry. While dowry was once common across many parts of India, its prevalence varies significantly between regions. Some communities within India continue to practice dowry, while others strongly discourage it. In general terms, dowry refers to the payment made to the parents of a bride or groom as an expression of gratitude for allowing their daughter/son to marry into the family. The amount paid depends largely on the social status of the couple and ranges anywhere from thousands of dollars to millions of dollars. This large sum of money is typically used to purchase land, cars, properties, etc., for the new family members. 
    While there is certainly nothing wrong with paying tribute to the families who allow you to get married, the issue arises when such payments become excessive. For instance, in certain rural areas of Maharashtra state, where dowries were banned until recently, several cases of human trafficking involving young girls from poorer backgrounds have been reported. These reports led to further calls for re-instating dowry practices, leading to protests throughout the state. Despite these recent setbacks, the debate surrounding dowry continues to rage on due to its cultural significance and influence on Indian society.","In many parts of the world, bride price is still used as a form of payment between families before marriage. This practice dates back thousands of years and there is nothing wrong with it per se. The problem comes when the amount of money involved becomes excessive, especially given that modern technology makes it easier than ever to get married without paying any dowry at all.

This imbalance between the value placed on women vs. men in modern culture is called the Masculine Dominant Ideal (MDI) and stems largely from the way in which human beings were socialized into hunter-gatherer societies. As a result, males typically had to compete against each other for access to food, whereas females tended to spend more time gathering resources together in groups. The MDI was codified during the Industrial Revolution, where factories required workers to conform to rigid schedules and adhere to strict quotas. In contrast, hunting and gathering societies did not require constant cooperation; rather, individuals would hunt alone or in small groups, depending on the availability of game.

A:

I think there are two main reasons why siblings might behave in different ways towards each other. 
Firstly, some people just naturally prefer certain types of behaviour from family members (e.g. parents). If one sibling tends to cause problems then another may end up avoiding that person out of fear of similar consequences arising. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the second sibling hates the first - sometimes we simply choose friends based on our likes/dislikes. So maybe the second sibling prefers the type of relationship where they get along well with the problematic sibling. In any case, it would be useful to understand whether the differences between the behaviours stem from personal preferences or more structural factors such as age or job roles etc.
Secondly, even if the behaviour stems purely from individual preference, it’s possible that the younger generation is less tolerant of conflict than previous generations. For instance, my wife grew up during the 1980s and 1990s when many families didn’t speak to each other for days if there was disagreement.

A:

I would say that there are two reasons why siblings might behave in different ways towards each other. 
The first reason is related to biology - some people are more similar than others (e.g., identical twins). If one sibling was genetically designed to act similarly to another, then they're likely going to react similarly to each other too. This means that even though they don't like each other, they still learn from each other. The second reason relates to culture; sometimes families adopt certain behaviors based on where they come from. For instance, many Asian cultures value harmony between family members whereas Western cultures prefer individuality.

563,0.009399999999999964,why do women think it's sexist to be praised and treated with attention?,why do men think it's sexist to be praised and treated with attention?,"Women in general believe it's sexist to praise and lavish attention on males. This stems from the idea that females were created to serve males, and thus any form of showing affection towards males (or even just acknowledging their existence) would be considered inappropriate. 

This isn't necessarily true though; there are many cultures around the world where such practices are common and accepted without issue. For instance, Japanese culture tends to value loyalty above all else, and shows respect and appreciation for family members regardless of gender. In Japan, it is completely normal for mothers to hold their babies close while singing lullabies, and fathers to take pride in supporting their families financially through hard times. Similarly, Chinese culture places great emphasis on filial piety, meaning parents will sacrifice themselves for their children out of love. While this might seem counterintuitive to Western ideals, it actually makes sense considering our hunter gatherer past, where survival depended heavily upon strong bonds between individuals. 

In summary, although it is certainly possible to praise and lavishly treat males with equal amounts of respect, it doesn't follow that doing so is inherently sexist. Instead, we must look at each society individually to determine whether these customs truly represent harmful biases against one group over another.","It's hardwired into our brains as humans to associate praise/attention with love/care. When we were born, our mothers gave us milk in order to ensure our survival. They didn't give us milk out of any sense of kindness; rather, they needed to provide nutrients necessary for growth. As infants, we did nothing but eat and grow - there was literally no benefit to giving us any sort of affection or attention. Over the course of thousands of years, though, human beings realized that receiving love and caring from others made us happier, more satisfied, and less likely to die young (which would then prevent us from reproducing). This led to the evolution of social norms around showing affection towards one another. 
    However, today, many cultures still reinforce the idea that only certain types of people deserve affection and recognition -- namely, males and females. For instance, most societies expect boys to play with toys designed for girls while girls are typically raised to be quiet and submissive. While these societal expectations might seem harmless at first glance, they actually cause significant mental anguish among individuals who don't conform to these standards.

A:

I think I would answer ""why"" first.  Why do sisters usually treat their daughters different from how they treat other sons?  Because most societies value females over males; therefore, society expects that daughters will follow the same path as their mother did (i.e., stay at home and take care of the family).  Sisters want to see their daughters succeed just like their mothers. 
The second question is harder. Why do brothers usually treat their sons different from how they treat other daughters?  That one requires some sociological insight into human behavior.  Most likely, it comes down to competition between male siblings for status within the family.  If two brothers compete against each other for dominance, then they might behave differently towards their younger sibling.

A:

I would say that in general, sisters (and mothers) tend to favour their own children more than others. 
This might come down to different reasons - some of these include:

Sisters/mothers grew up with siblings themselves, therefore they understand better how to take care of multiple kids rather than just one.
They were raised by same couple, where mom was usually the main caregiver, thus they see themselves as responsible for another person's well-being.
They had less opportunities to date before getting married, and now they want to spend their lives with their spouse, so they put extra effort into making their partner happy.
Some people prefer to have multiple children under one roof, since it reduces the chance of divorce.

Why do sisters always mistreat them and are always neglecting them?
Sisters often treat their daughters differently from how they treat other sons, which can be both positive and negative. On average, women tend to favor their own children over those of men, so if your sister is raising you she may feel that she has to make sure you have everything you need because she believes you will leave her soon enough.

587,1.8654000000000002,why do women tend to get into trouble with patriarchal society?,why do men tend to get into trouble with patriarchal society?,"Women in patriarchal societies face many challenges. One challenge is that they are socialized to defer to men, especially fathers. This means that even though women might want to contribute ideas or take initiative, they still accept the idea that a man (usually their father) knows better than they do. Another challenge facing women is that they are expected to stay “practical” and focus only on earning money and supporting the family. When women pursue interests outside of these roles, they are seen as ungrateful and selfish. These expectations put pressure on women to conform to traditional gender roles, leading some women to engage in behaviors that deviate from these roles, such as substance abuse or risky behavior. 

Another reason why women experience problems within patriarchal society comes down to power dynamics between men and women. Men typically hold more power in patriarchal society, since they control access to resources and decision making authority. Women who seek out higher education or careers usually end up feeling frustrated due to lack of opportunities compared to men. As a result, women often turn to abusive relationships or self harm in order to express their frustration.","Men in patriarchal societies face many challenges. One challenge is that traditional roles assigned to genders (masculine vs feminine) create barriers between men and women. For instance, traditionally masculine jobs such as construction or manufacturing require more physical strength than feminine jobs such as nursing. This creates additional barriers for men trying to break through these barriers and pursue careers that require less strength. Another challenge facing men is that there aren't as many opportunities available to them compared to women. Traditionally male pursuits such as sports or business don’t receive as much funding or support.

The answer lies in the meaning of ""sister"".  In many cultures, especially Asian culture, girls grow up learning that they are related to their mother (or father).  This means that they are considered property of their parents until marriage age.  If a girl marries her older brother, she becomes part of his family and thusly treated as any other member of his family.  She now belongs to him and his friends, and must act accordingly.  Her previous life as a free woman is gone forever.

In fact, studies show that married dads are more likely than single parents to participate in child rearing and domestic labor while moms are more likely to engage in paid employment. This imbalance can create challenges around balancing parenting responsibilities between spouses. 

A better solution might be to encourage both parents to share equally in these tasks. For instance, mothers might devote themselves to childrearing while dads dedicate some amount of time each week to household maintenance (e.g., cooking meals, cleaning house).","Mothers typically dedicate themselves exclusively to working outside of the home while fathers play many different roles within the family such as provider, caregiver, educator, etc. This division of labor allows mothers to focus solely on child rearing without worrying about any other responsibilities. However, there are some studies showing that even though mothers spend more hours per week caring for young children than fathers, they still earn less money on average.

I am going to answer part 1 first since I think it answers the question well.  Part 2 would require additional context before answering. 
Why do mothers only work outside of marriage and neglect other roles in their families?
The short answer is that motherhood requires a lot of energy and attention.  It is physically demanding (especially during pregnancy) and emotionally draining.   As a result, most societies assign the role of parenting to married couples.  This means that mothers must balance their careers with their parenting duties.  If they don't take on additional career commitments then they risk losing their jobs.  On the other hand, fathers",0.9743,0.876

Why do brothers treat their sons different than they treat their daughters? 
Brothers typically treat their sons differently than they treat their daughters.

However, this could also lead to not spending as much time with you or letting you do things like go to sleep at night on him lap instead of keeping you up all night long. It's important for you to remember that no matter what your brother does, he loves you very much and wants the best for you.

I think there are two main reasons why people might treat their kids differently than others' kids. The first reason is simply that parents naturally want to raise their own kids more closely than any outsider (e.g., teacher) might expect. This is partly biological - our brains evolved to process information relevant only to ourselves, so we naturally pay attention to our own offspring. But it goes beyond biology too - many parents genuinely believe that raising their own kid better prepares them for parenting another child later in life, and thus makes sense even without any evolutionary benefit. 
The second reason is related to the first one but focuses on the parent/child relationship itself. Parents naturally want to see themselves as the primary source of knowledge and guidance for their kids, and since they're usually the ones paying most of the bills, they naturally assume that they should be able to provide the best advice.

Many cultures throughout history have valued marriage between equals, where one party provides support and comfort to the other without requiring any special powers or abilities. For instance, many people would consider marrying a friend rather than someone more suitable based solely upon friendship alone. Similarly, while women might require divine intervention to become wives (i.e., virgins), once married these women still provide emotional support and companionship to their husbands.

A:

The answer lies in the meaning of ""sister"".  In many cultures, there exists a social construct called the nuclear family where two parents raise their children together.  This means that most people grow up knowing only one parent (usually mom) and spend significant amounts of time with that person alone.  If a child grows up without a mother, society tends to assume that the child was neglected/abandoned by his/her biological parents.  Sisters therefore might behave towards their younger siblings in certain ways based on their experience growing up with just one parent - i.e., they're more likely to take better care of them than they would a son.

To provide a non biased response, first understand that there isn't just one definition of ""gender"" - there are many different ones.  There is no way to give a complete answer without understanding exactly what these definitions mean.  So lets start with a simple definition of gender:
Gender = The categories into which humans are assigned based upon physical characteristics such as male/female.
Now, lets look at two examples where people might use the word gender incorrectly.  First, consider the phrase ""he's a man"".  This means nothing more than he is physically male.  It says nothing about whether he behaves like a man, thinks like a man, etc...  In fact, most would argue that behavior is irrelevant to determining gender!

A:

I think I would answer ""why"" using examples from my personal experience growing up with two sisters. 
Sisters typically take care of younger siblings whereas brothers usually take care of older ones. This means that sisters spend most of their free time with us (older) kids since we're closer in age to them compared to our relationship to them. In contrast, brothers generally don't spend any time with us kids since they're already adults themselves. 
Aside from that, there's another difference between sisters and brothers - sisters love each other just like anyone else; they support one another, comfort each other etc. Whereas, brothers might argue sometimes but deep down they still see each other as competitors.

A:

Sisters often treat their daughters differently from how they treat other sons, which can be both positive and negative. 

This sounds like a stereotype but there is some truth behind it.  In many cultures girls grow up learning that they must be submissive to their mothers (or female elders) whereas boys typically learn that they are independent and self sufficient. 
As a result, girls may see themselves as second class citizens compared to their sisters.  They may therefore view any attention given to them as a privilege rather than something earned.  If they don’t receive such attention then they may become resentful and even jealous.

A:

I would say that there are two reasons. One is biological - males are born with X chromosomes whereas females are XX, therefore boys grow faster than girls leading to parents preferring sons. The second reason is social/cultural. In many societies (eastern Europe included) girls usually stay at home until marriage, so they don't need to take care of themselves yet fathers see them less since they're still living at home.

             where p.ProductID == 1 && p.CategoryID == 2

One factor is that women generally view themselves as caretakers, while men see themselves as protectors. This means that even though a woman might be physically stronger than a man, she still views herself more as a caregiver, and thus tends to take on the role of nurturer. Another reason is that women historically were socialized to defer to men, whereas today most men want to be seen as leaders. These two dynamics combine to create situations where women expect deference and respect, while men expect leadership and autonomy. 

A final point worth noting is that women typically experience life through a feminine lens, viewing things from a subjective perspective, while men typically experience life through a masculine lens, viewing things objectively. When interacting with another person, therefore, a woman usually looks at things subjectively, seeing things from her point of view, looking for ways to improve her situation. A man, on the other hand, sees things objectively, without bias, and focuses on getting something done. Because women traditionally look outside of themselves for approval, validation, and love, they naturally seek these things elsewhere too - into relationships with others.

1) Wives want to protect their family line, hence they look for qualities in their spouse that would pass down the genes to future generations. 
2) The wife prefers to stay at home and take care of the kids since most times the couple doesn't fall in love until later in life once the kid(s) grow up. Hence the woman feels more secure staying back at least till then. 

A:

I think there are two main factors here - one biological (the preference for male offspring), and another social/cultural (wives preferring their husbands).  The latter I'm less certain about but my understanding is that many cultures encourage monogamy within marriage, where only one person is married to one man at any given time.  This means that while some people might date multiple partners during their lifetime, they generally don't marry anyone until they've found ""the one"".  So perhaps wives simply aren't looking outside their current relationship?

It seems there isn't one way that relationships are different based on gender. Both sisters and brothers treat their siblings differently depending on whether they are a daughter/sons or a son/daughter pair. 

A better answer would provide context around these differences in treatment. For instance, I'm assuming here that the sibling pair is related (i.e., same parents). If we expand upon this further, then perhaps the difference in treatment stems from the fact that mothers typically prefer to spend time with their own children whereas fathers generally prefer to spend time with their children regardless of whom they are. In addition, many cultures value the importance of placing children under the authority of either their mother or father, respectively. This means that even though a child may look to his/her mom for guidance, ultimately s/he must defer to his/her dad since that is the cultural expectation.

A:

The answer lies in the meaning of ""sister"". 
In modern English usage, we usually use the word sister to refer to female relatives (usually older) who live close to us but don't necessarily share our biological relationship. In some olden times, people used the term sister to mean only one related to the same father; nowadays, most people would say that they love each other just like any siblings. So there is nothing wrong with sisters treating their daughters differently from how they treat other sons.

As a result, they learned to trust their instincts and rely more heavily on their intuition than logic. Another possible explanation is that your wife simply doesn't realize how much she is hurting your feelings by going on these diets. She probably thinks that she needs to lose weight in order to improve her health and well-being, but you're worried about her health more than anything else. If you really want her to stop dieting, you should talk to her about it. Explaining to her that you love her just the way she is and that worrying so much about her weight isn't healthy won't be easy, but it's something that she needs to consider whether she actually wants to keep going down this path.","Sisters and brothers typically treat their daughters/sons (and husbands) differently than they would treat another daughter/son.

I think there are several reasons. 
Firstly, many cultures value different traits in a man - e.g. height, hair colour etc. So one parent may prefer a certain trait in a partner. Secondly, each generation tends to look towards its grandparents for guidance on parenting practices. Finally, even within families, siblings may differ significantly in personality type, interests etc., making it difficult to set common ground.

I think there might be some confusion between ""mother"" and ""daughter"".  In the context of family relationships, mother refers to one's biological parent (usually the woman).  Daughter usually means female child of either sex.

How to get the value of a select option using jquery?

<select name=""country"">
   <option>USA</option>

   <option>Canada</option>
</select>

$(""#country"").change(function(){
     alert($(""option:selected"",this).val()); // This doesn't work!
});

What am I missing here?

A:

You're trying to use :selected selector on <option>, while it accepts only element selection. Use.val() on the selected <option>:
$('#country').on('change', function () {
    var val = $(this).find('option:selected').val();
});

This tradition started during times when families were poorer than today and needed to ensure their daughter was well taken care of financially once they got married. In modern India, many people still believe that money can buy happiness, so many parents continue to insist on giving their daughter an expensive dowry even though there isn't necessarily any evidence that it makes a person happier.","Husbands usually expect more money than just a ring in return for marrying his son. This might seem fair since the wife provides the financial support during marriage but many times it creates unfair expectations between parents and kids later down the line. A better solution would be to lower the bride price and allow the couple to save some funds until they start a family together. 

A:

I think there are two main reasons here. The first one is related to the traditional view of the role of man vs woman. Men traditionally were responsible for earning income, supporting the family etc., while women were primarily caregivers/housekeepers. Over the years, these roles have become blurred (or even reversed) leading to the second reason. 
Thesis 1 - Traditional Role of Man vs Woman
In today's world where technology plays a major part, most people earn their living through their profession rather than staying at home. As a result, the traditional role of man vs woman is becoming less relevant. In such a scenario, the expectation of a man towards his wife changes drastically. He now expects her to provide him with a comfortable lifestyle without compromising on anything else. Hence, the idea of demanding a high bride price.

A better way to express yourself would be to tell your wife how you really feel - by showing her that you truly do value and respect her. Here are some ideas to get started:

Therefore, wives must learn to take charge of household management too! Here are several tips to get started: 
  * Ask your wife to keep track of expenses - Many couples live paycheck to paycheck, but managing bills together takes communication and coordination. If one person handles the finances, each spouse knows where money goes and there is less stress overall. 
  * Take turns cooking meals - Cooking is a shared activity that creates a sense of community within the family. Tearing meat into small pieces and passing it around the table teaches kids to be team players. 
  * Clean house regularly - Cleaning makes everyone feel better. When the floors aren't dirty, the kitchen doesn't smell bad, and clothes don't stink, people are more likely to put effort into maintaining the home.

First, many spouses would argue that their role is to provide support and guidance to their partner, and therefore require more involvement in domestic activities. Second, there is evidence suggesting that women typically perform most of the housework while men only assist due to traditional roles associated with masculinity (i.e., physical strength). In addition, studies have shown that couples where one spouse performs most of the housework report higher levels of satisfaction compared to couples where the opposite occurs.

For instance, some wives might believe their husband would abandon them one day without warning, but this is unlikely since most men want to spend more time with their wife before they consider leaving her. Some wives might think their husband doesn't love them anymore, but this is highly unlikely given that many couples stay together for decades even though there isn’t physical contact between them. 

The main reason why husbands mistreat their girlfriend is probably due to lack of understanding of the concept of marital fidelity. Marital fidelity means never cheating on your partner. When a man starts seeing other people during marriage, he is committing adultery. Adultery is considered a major sin in Islam. Therefore, the punishment for an adulterer is death. This makes it hard for a man to see sense and behave properly towards his girlfriend.","Wives sometimes treat their partners in a way that shows disregard for their partner's feelings and safety. This can include yelling, slapping, or even locking them out of the house. These actions put tremendous pressure on the couple to maintain the relationship regardless of its impact on their mental health. Wives might think that they are protecting their partner by treating them harshly, but in reality, they are actually putting themselves at risk. If a wife was abusive towards her previous partner, there is a high likelihood that she would continue abusing her current partner. Therefore, it is essential for couples to communicate openly and honestly without relying on physical violence. They must set limits on how far each person is allowed to go within these boundaries, allow sufficient space between them, and ensure that neither person feels unsafe. 

A:

I am going to answer my own question here since I found the solution myself. 
The problem lies in the fact that the chatbot uses the word ""treats"". In English we use the verb ""to treat"" only when giving medical treatment to animals. So the proper term for husbands/wives is ""husband/wife treats"", where the prepositional phrase describes the action (i.e., husband/wife puts).

I guess maybe there isn't any one answer but perhaps it comes down to the fact that we haven't learned how to properly parent yet. When we become parents our lives change in many ways including the way we interact with others. We learn to put aside our desires and focus entirely on making sure our child grows into adulthood healthy and happy. As new parents we spend countless hours reading books, watching documentaries, attending classes, etc. All these experiences teach us patience, empathy, and how to listen carefully without necessarily saying what we want to say. These skills take practice and require consistency and commitment from both mother and father. 

A lot of people assume that once you're married and have kids then suddenly you stop growing as a person. This couldn't be further from the truth! In fact, parenting is arguably the most challenging experience anyone can ever face. But now that we've done it, we realize just how difficult it was to get here in the first place.

In addition, many religious orders require members to live a life of poverty, leading some nuns to use money given to them by God to buy material goods that would otherwise be forbidden to them.

However, there are some downsides to this idea. First of all, most women still prefer to spend time with their families, leaving them unable to fully commit to running a company full time. Secondly, studies have found that although women are generally more empathetic than men, they also take longer to make decisions.

I'm going to answer part 1 first since it deals more directly with the question asked in the body of the post.  Part 2 follows shortly thereafter. 
Why do sisters always treat their daughters differently from how they treat other sons?
Sisters typically treat their daughters differently from how they treat other daughters due to the fact that they raised them themselves.  This means they spent lots of quality time with them growing up learning how to take care of babies, cook, clean, etc...  They then had to teach these skills to their younger sibling (the daughter) during their childhood years.  It would be natural for them to want to pass down these lessons to the next generation.  On the flip side, brothers typically treat their sons different than how they treat their daughters simply because boys were traditionally seen as ""stronger"" and girls were considered weaker.  So naturally they'd want to see differences between the two.

For instance, many men would rather take out a mortgage than pay child support to their ex-wife.  On the flip side, some men don't value family life and prefer to pursue career goals without considering the impact on their relationships with their kids.  In general, most men want to balance parenthood with personal success, but sometimes these desires conflict and cause tension within the relationship.

805,0.3116,why do women struggle with their husbands becoming more and more selfish?,why do men struggle with their wives becoming more and more selfish?,"It's hard to say exactly why this happens but there are many reasons that come to mind. One reason might be that in our society we see so little value placed on family that men don't really view themselves as part of a team anymore where everyone looks out for each other. Another possible cause is that as we get older we start to take on more responsibility within the house and therefore expect less from our spouses. Finally, some people believe that men become more selfish due to evolution; they think that since men were once hunters and gatherers they still prefer to rely on their physical strength rather than relying on words alone to keep relationships strong.","It is hard for men to understand that their wife might want to spend less time with family in order to give themselves more attention.  This can cause resentment within a marriage. Men typically see their role as provider, but it is equally important to provide time for yourself so that you can grow personally too. 

A great way to encourage selflessness in your spouse is to model it for them.

First off, I don't think most women were designed to be flight attendants. Women typically weren't raised in environments where they had to take off and land aircraft every day. They might have been taught how to fly but more likely just got on a plane without any instruction. This means they aren't used to dealing with all the extra weight and equipment that comes along with commercial aviation. Men, on the other hand, are generally born into families who expect them to become pilots. So even though they might not be naturally gifted at it, they're trained well enough to handle the job. Also, many jobs in general require a certain amount of strength and agility. Flight attendants especially must be able to balance a lot of different items while wearing heavy gear. A man would probably be better suited for such a position than a woman.

Ask questions like “How did you learn to pilot?”","I believe there are several reasons for this.

I think the answer lies somewhere in the middle - while I agree that men are notorious for abusing women, I don't believe that men are any worse than women at abusive behaviour. 
The reason? Men and women differ significantly in terms of socialisation. Women are generally raised to be submissive members of society, whereas men are encouraged to be strong leaders and providers.

In most cases where couples pay for their weddings together, the cost is split between both parties. This means that while one person might end up paying more than another due to higher income, everyone ends up saving money compared to hiring a planner. Also keep in mind that some cultures don't allow married couples to invite friends/family into the marriage, therefore forcing them to cut costs even further.","Grooms usually have to pay more than $50,000 for his wedding. This cost is extremely high compared to the average American weddings where couples spend around $25,000-$30,000. The reason behind such expensive weddings is that grooms typically have to buy rings, bouquets, reception hall space, etc., in order to complete the ceremony and the rest of the events leading up to the big day. While brides get free of charge, grooms still end up paying a lot since most grooms cannot afford these expenses without financial assistance from their parents. 

In addition to the expense, many people criticize grooms' weddings for being overly formal and stuffy. For instance, grooms might wear tuxedos while some guests prefer dress pants or jeans. Also, grooms might serve alcohol during the cocktail hour but guests would rather drink beer or wine. Grooms sometimes even have to rent out halls for receptions and banquet facilities.

This type of behavior stems from the desire to avoid causing any unnecessary suffering.

A:

I would say that it depends on the relationship between siblings. If one sibling is older/younger then another (eg elder son vs younger daughter) - the answer changes. 
If two siblings are equal age - generally speaking, parents usually prefer to raise boys rather than girls. This is due to the fact that boys typically become fathers while girls mostly stay at home. So basically, parents want to ensure that their kids get married and start families. 
On the contrary, if two siblings are younger than others - again, generally speaking, parents prefer to raise girl children. They might still believe that boy children will grow up faster and take better care of themselves, but actually they are wrong. Girls require more attention and care compared to boys.

Bachelor usually means single, but there are many people who are widowed or divorced. In addition, some people choose to remain unmarried until later stages of life. So bachelor actually refers to anyone who doesn't have any commitment yet. 
Married ladies implies couple lives together and share responsibilities. That makes them more likely to take responsibility for themselves and their families.

I'm going to answer my own question here since I got some great feedback from people on Reddit. The reason why sisters sometimes treat their daughters different from how they treat other sons is simply due to human nature. 
Sisters want to protect their daughters from bad influences (such as boys) while still allowing them freedom to grow into adulthood without parental guidance. This creates tension between the two goals, leading to the behavior we see today where sisters might put their daughters first but still expect them to act like ladies.

A landlord might refuse to accept a lease outright, requiring the tenant to sign a month-to-month tenancy while giving notice upon any termination of the written contract. Landlords sometimes require security deposits or prepayment of monthly rent before accepting leases; some jurisdictions provide statutory protections against such requirements but many still opt to demand high down payments due to the risk of default.

In fact, according to one study, ""men are actually less likely to advance into senior management roles than women"". This makes sense since traditionally women were considered to be better caregivers and nurturers, but these days we see more evidence that men are just as capable as women in these areas. So while it might seem intuitive that men would naturally gravitate towards higher level leadership roles, historically this hasn't been true.  In my personal opinion, I believe this is due to societal conditioning around gender roles where men are seen as natural leaders and women prefer caring roles.

A:

The answer depends on whether we're talking about humans or machines here. 
If we're talking about humans then there isn't one single reason - each person is different and therefore causes different behaviours. But generally speaking, human beings are complex creatures; some are empathetic, others are cold hearted, yet others again are both. So even though a human being raised by two sisters would probably grow up thinking that his/her needs come first (and thus likely becoming cold and distant), another human being raised by two mothers would likely grow up feeling loved and wanted. Therefore, while it's true that siblings raise each other more than any other pair of individuals, it doesn't follow that everyone raised by siblings ends up behaving similarly to their sibling(s).

One rule states that they must never refuse any request made by another nun.

The penalty for breaking this rule is excommunication from the church, ostracism from society, and eternal damnation. Nuns who break this rule face certain death.

While loneliness can sometimes cause people to seek companionship, there are many cases where individuals prefer to live life without any form of relationship. For instance, some people grow up thinking that relationships bring too much stress into their lives, making them less likely to consider one later in life. Additionally, while most humans naturally gravitate toward similar types of personalities, dating a person whose personality differs greatly from yours can actually increase your overall happiness levels.

In fact, many cisgender males found us to be quite annoying due to our constant whining and crying. 
    I think there is some truth to the idea that cis women lack certain masculine traits, but I believe most of the difference lies within the environment a child grows up in rather than innate differences between genders. Cisgender females still grow up feeling pressure to act more feminine than they actually are (which is why so many of us end up in careers such as nursing or teaching), while transmen typically grew up knowing they didn't fit into either category and thus never felt pressured to act in a particular manner.

A:

I think there might be some confusion here between ""sister"", ""brother"" and ""woman"". 
Sisters don't necessarily mean one is related to another woman (although many people still use the term). A sister means two individuals share the same biological mother but different fathers. So technically speaking, you could say that a sister treats her own daughter/son just as well as she treats any son/daughter born to her. But I doubt most people would agree that a sister treats her own daughter/son better than she treats her own son/daughter. The latter seems more likely to me.
Brothers and sisters actually refer to half-sisters and -brothers respectively. These terms come from the fact that until recently, siblings were usually raised together. Nowadays though, we see fewer kids growing up with both parents working, so these days, almost everyone has a step-parent or even a grandparent looking out for them. This creates new dynamics around parenting and sibling relationships. Half-sisters and",Men typically put their families first. This means they spend more time with their family than themselves.

Mothers carry babies in their wombs for nine months, giving them nutrients necessary for growth and survival. They breastfeed infants until six months old, ensuring proper nutrition continues throughout childhood. Moms spend hours a day interacting with their children, teaching them values such as kindness, cooperation, and empathy. In addition, moms take great pride in looking after their families, making sure everyone in the household receives love, attention, and affection. 
  Mothers invest heavily into growing these young lives, constantly monitoring their every move, seeking out new experiences, exposing them to different cultures and learning languages. This allows them to bond with their children early on, forming deep connections that last a lifetime. Children grow up knowing that they were loved by a mother, and that love was passed down through generations. Fathers, on the other hand, don't get to see their children grow up. They only learn about their kids existence once they're born.

A:

I'm going to answer part 1 first since it seems to be related to the question asked. 
Why do sisters always mistreat them and are always neglecting them?
Sisters often treat their daughters differently from how they treat other sons, which can be both positive and negative. On average, women tend to favor their own children over those of men, so if your sister is raising you she may feel that she has to make sure you have everything you need because she believes you will leave her soon enough. However, this could also lead to not spending as much time with you or letting you do things like go to sleep at night on her lap instead of keeping you up all night long.

A:

I think I might have found my answer!  It seems that the reason why sisters sometimes treat their daughters differently than they treat their sons is because most women prefer to spend more time with their daughters since girls typically take care of the younger generation whereas boys usually takes care of the older generations.  This means that even though some sisters may want to spend more time with their daughters, they don't necessarily have the luxury of doing so given that they're still responsible for taking care of themselves (and therefore their son).  On the other hand, brothers seem to naturally treat their sons similarly to how they'd treat their daughters because they're generally looking out for their younger sibling hence making them similar in nature.

In addition, many grandparents expect their grandchildren to spend a lot of time with them, even though this might not necessarily be beneficial for the child’s development. Grandparents should consider these issues before giving out more presents to their grandchildren.

A:

I think there are several reasons why one might prefer to date later in life.  One reason is simply biological - many species live longer lives once they reach adulthood.  Humans included. 
Another reason is practical; we generally learn more from our experiences as we age, and older adults typically have more experience to draw upon.  This means they're likely to provide better guidance on issues such as career paths, family dynamics, etc., since they've had these experiences themselves.
Finally, there is the issue of compatibility.  As humans age together, we become less similar physically (e.g. hair color changes), mentally (e.g. different political views) and emotionally (e.g. different parenting styles).  In contrast, young people are still relatively similar in terms of physical appearance, mental outlook, and parenting style.  Thus, while an older person may lack youthful appeal, they may still be compatible with you due to shared values, interests, and personality traits.

When people take care of others (especially ones they love) they get attached to them. When we take care of something we start loving it. So yes, maids want to be taken care of by their employers. They don't want to do hard jobs but they really enjoy working for people whom they see as family.

How to use multiple conditions inside where clause?

A:

You cannot nest queries within another query. What you can do though is create a subquery that returns either one row or zero rows depending on whether the condition passes:

Dear Sir/Madam,
Thank you for writing in.  It really helps to get feedback from others like yourself!
Suffice to say, I think you're handling this situation well.  Your sister seems to genuinely love you and is trying to provide for you.  You seem to understand where she is coming from (at least subconsciously) and are responding appropriately - asking questions to better understand her perspective.
That said, I wonder whether you might consider talking to her about it more directly.  Perhaps suggest that you'd like to spend some quality time together outside of the traditional family unit structure; perhaps cook dinner one evening, or simply sit down and discuss something fun that you've been thinking about.  If you approach these conversations with sincerity and humility, I believe she will likely reciprocate.

She might assume that most people won't report her since they trust her and therefore she doesn't risk losing business due to bad reviews. 

A:

I'm going to answer my own question here. The reason why sisters treat their daughters different from how they treat other sons is because they want to ensure that their daughters grow up strong and independent in order to take care of themselves later in life. This means that they don't spend as much time with their daughters compared to the amount of time they spend with their sons. 
Sisters treating their daughters differently from how they treat other sons isn't necessarily a bad thing though, it actually shows them that they're doing the right thing by ensuring that their daughters are taken care of properly.

Wives might put more effort into making sure their children have everything they need without showing too much affection. For instance, they might buy gifts for the child even though they don't necessarily want to spend lots of money on the gift.

A:

The answer provided here is based on my personal experience growing up Catholic.  My parents raised me and two older siblings (one younger) in a strict household.  We went to church every Sunday morning, attended school functions during the week, and participated in various activities outside of school such as scouting, sports teams, etc.  Our house was never messy; we had set routines for eating meals, getting ready for bed, and generally behaving ourselves.  If we didn't behave, our punishment involved losing privileges - whether it was going out of town, missing out on certain activities, or simply having to sit quietly while adults talked to us.  This approach worked well for most kids, although some of us did rebel against authority.  One sibling got into trouble more than others, mostly due to his impulsiveness and lack of discipline.
