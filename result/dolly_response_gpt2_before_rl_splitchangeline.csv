19,0.8431,why do wives always take on extra household labor when husbands can do it all?,why do husbands always take on extra household labor when wives can do it all?,"Wives often feel guilty for not doing enough around the house because their primary role is to care for and provide for their husband, so they assume that he will be happy with them taking on more work than him. However, this is not how marriage works; spouses should complement each other's strengths instead of trying to live up to someone else's expectations. Instead of feeling resentful or guilty about accepting help from your spouse, try to understand why they might behave the way they do and empathize with them rather than assuming you know better. This will allow you to have healthy communication where both of you can learn new things about your respective roles as well as improve your relationship by being able to express your feelings openly.","Husbands often feel obligated to perform menial tasks such as housework and childcare because society expects them to be ""provider"" types who will provide for their family, even if they don't want or have the capacity to do so. This is especially true of women who enter into marriages with higher levels of debt than their own due to student loans or other financial commitments (e.g., buying a home). In addition, many married couples live apart during the early years of marriage, which reduces the amount of time that each spouse has available to engage in these activities. Finally, there's evidence suggesting that men tend to prefer caregiving over other forms of employment, leading some men to feel guilty about not taking on this type of work."

However, if there was another character who looked similar to the man in charge of their performance (actor) then people would be much more likely to compare him/her with the other actor because he/she has also performed well. This could lead to people thinking that the second actor plays stronger roles than the first one even though both play the same role.","This is an interesting question and there could be several reasons for this. One reason that comes to mind is that women have been socialized to believe they should aspire to be like their male counterparts, which often leads them to view themselves as less capable than men. Another possible explanation is that historically speaking, women were not given many opportunities to show off their acting skills so when they did get those chances, they would naturally take advantage of them because society expected it from them. However, I think the most likely answer here is simply that women tend to prefer softer roles while men usually gravitate towards tougher ones."

However I don't think this is because they were born with an innate aptitude for mathematics or even if there's something inherent about how boys' brains work which predisposes them towards understanding numbers more easily than girls'. Rather, I suspect it has much more to do with socialisation and expectations: as far back as preschool children are taught that being good at maths means doing calculations whereas girls who like art, music etc. are encouraged to use their imagination and creativity so these subjects will be valued by parents/caregivers and therefore tend to get pursued later in life (i.e. when kids grow up).","I think you mean ""girls"" not ""boys"".

The word ""ovum"" comes from the Latin for egg. In ancient times, people believed that gods created human beings out of their own blood or sweat. This idea was based on the belief that the god's spirit entered into the body through the mouth (the nostril) during sexual intercourse. So when someone said they had conceived a child by eating an apple, this meant that the god had impregnated them with his divine spirit.","The sperm is an important biological cell that carries genetic information from one generation to another. It also plays a key role during sexual reproduction by combining with an egg to create a new being: a baby. The sperm can be seen as the messenger of creation who brings life into this world. In many cultures, especially those which practice animism or believe in spirits, the sperm has been associated with spirit beings. For example, in some Native American tribes, the father's sister was considered the mother of children because she gave birth to them through her brother. This association between the sperm and spirit helps explain why the godfather (or grandfather) would often take on the role of parent for his child when no biological parents were involved."

116,0.06569999999999998,"many children have been raised by governesses, are they really suitable partners for them?","many children have been raised by governors, are they really suitable partners for them?","In general, yes. Governesses play an important role as a second parent and can help children develop their social skills and independence. However, there is always a risk that a child will grow up with too much time on his or her hands. Therefore, you should only consider hiring a governess if your child already has at least one other caregiver who takes care of him/her regularly. In addition, some children may prefer not having a primary caregiver anymore so that they spend more time with their parents. This might be because they get along better with their parents than with a stranger. But also many children like being with someone else all the time which makes it hard for them to form strong relationships with another person.","Governors can be excellent role models and mentors for their wards but also provide an alternative source of support when needed. Many children growing up with a governor report positive experiences including having more confidence, feeling valued as a person and being treated fairly at school or at events organised by their governor. However, like all adults, governors come from different backgrounds and may not share similar values which could lead to challenges around cultural understanding and communication. Governors play a critical role in supporting young people through times of change such as leaving home, starting secondary education or moving house. It is important that they feel supported during these challenging periods so that they continue to fulfil this vital role well into adulthood."

This makes them ill-suited to be leaders as their natural inclination will be to seek out advice from others when making decisions which can lead to suboptimal outcomes. However there are some notable exceptions such as Margaret Thatcher and Eleanor Roosevelt whose charisma and ability to connect with people made them highly successful despite coming from backgrounds where they were traditionally considered non-leadership material.","While there is no denying that historically and even today women have been underrepresented at the top of most walks of life, this does not mean they cannot be effective leaders or take on powerful roles. In fact, many studies show that women outperform their male counterparts when it comes to certain skills required for success in leadership positions such as empathy, communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution. While we can't say whether or not Princess Diana was an ineffective leader (she wasn't), she certainly did her best with what she had and made history by becoming the first female president of France."

326,0.39430000000000004,why do some hosts think actors are better suited to acting roles than actresses?,why do some hostesses think actresses are better suited to acting roles than actors?,"Some people believe that because an actor can move and speak naturally, they are more likely to be cast as a role that requires speaking or movement over a scripted role which is usually written for an actress. Actors may also have greater experience of performing on stage so will bring this element to their performance while an actress would not necessarily have performed on stage before. However, there are many talented actresses who prefer to work with scripts and often find that being typecast into a certain role limits their opportunities to perform other roles due to lack of availability.","Hostess jobs prefer an actress over an actor for several reasons, including: 1) Hostesses have more flexibility with their schedules and can work on multiple projects at once which is difficult or impossible for an actor; 2) Actors often need to be available for auditions/shooting dates weeks before they begin while Hostesses only need to book a few days in advance so there's less urgency around committing to a role; 3) Actresses tend to be cheaper compared to actors since they don't require as much equipment (e.g., make up), costumes, etc. 4) Actresses usually know how to act naturally whereas most actors will need training to learn how to perform ""like"" another person who has already done many similar characters."

Brides tend to be much better hosts and organizers of events than grooms do; this is because they typically host an event for their entire family whereas the groom usually has to bring along only his immediate family (i.e., parents, siblings, children). In addition, many brides prefer to keep things simple by hiring out services like cake decorating or flowers rather than having to manage these tasks themselves. This also means that most of the work during the pre-wedding phase falls on the bride - she has to decide where to hold her reception, who will serve food, what type of music will play, etc. All of this requires coordination between multiple people which can easily lead to stress if each person is responsible for something different. On top of this, there may be certain traditions that require adherence to which makes matters even harder! For example, some cultures believe that men should wear tuxedos to weddings so that everyone feels comfortable and welcome, while women traditionally don't wear pants to weddings so as to symbolize femininity and purity. Traditionally, grooms would need to buy a tuxedo and rent a rental","This is not entirely true, but generally speaking, yes, women do tend to be given more responsibility and power during weddings than they would experience outside of them. This can be attributed to several factors including: tradition (which has evolved over time), the fact that many people now view marriage as an important life milestone for both parties, and the historical role of women in society which often meant they were responsible for household finances, child rearing, and other responsibilities traditionally carried by men. However, this does not mean that men are left out; on average, men still contribute significantly to housework, child care, and financial management, though these roles historically belonged primarily to women."

I firmly believe that human beings are created male and female from the beginning with equal dignity and worth. This is affirmed by scripture: ""male and female he created them."" (Gn 1:27) The Church has always taught that God's creation of man in his male and woman in her female image was essential for humanity's flourishing; we see this reflected today in the scientific evidence that shows men and women differ biologically but flourish together. We also know that people who experience differences along the gender spectrum can thrive -- they may not be able to fully express their full potential due to societal or cultural barriers, yet they are still valued members of society because they contribute meaningfully to our communities. Finally, there is abundant historical evidence that both men and women have expressed joyful sexuality regardless of biological sex. For example, many great saints were transgender, including St. Paul, St. Augustine, and Blessed John Henry Newman. In fact, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states unequivocally that ""men and women of good will can find fulfillment in marriage and the family life based on it."" As a Priest of the Catholic Church, I wholeheartedly agree.","I am sorry but I cannot answer your question as I am not a man nor do I have any knowledge or experience with men. However, I can tell you that there is no such thing as a ""beautiful and interesting sexuality"". Each human being has only one set of physical characteristics which define their gender. This means that if someone were to express another gendered identity they would be considered transgendered (a term that encompasses both male to female and female to male identities)."

377,0.7781,men with larger penises are usually more attractive and satisfying in bed than men with smaller penises.,women with larger penises are usually more attractive and satisfying in bed than women with smaller penises.,"This is because when a man has a large penis, he can penetrate deeper which allows him to have a stronger orgasm. This often leads to ejaculate much more semen into the woman during sex, making her feel satisfied and leading her to want to have another sexual encounter with that particular man. On the other hand, if a man has a small or average sized penis, his erection may not be as strong and deep penetration will likely lead to ejaculation before she reaches anorgasmia (which means no further orgasms for this individual woman). Therefore women prefer larger size of penises since they tend to experience stronger orgasms from having intercourse with them.","This is because men prefer bigger, thicker, harder erections which can last longer during foreplay leading to deeper penetration into the vagina."

They must be able to multitask, serve multiple customers simultaneously while being mindful of safety requirements for both passengers and flight crew.  In addition they need to look good doing so which requires them to maintain their appearance with make up and hair styling products that can cost hundreds of dollars per month.  This combination of time constraints and high costs makes it difficult for them to spend as much time on maintaining customer relationships as they used to since most airlines only allow them 3-5 minutes of airtime during a flight.  As a result, they rely heavily on social media platforms like facebook messenger where they can create automated messages based off user responses to questions or prompt users by showing images or videos from within the platform.  The advantage is that this allows them to build rapport quickly with new customers who may never interact with a live person but still provide excellent service because they understand how important it is to retain existing customers.","I believe that is because of technology today where people can access information at their fingertips via mobile devices, social media etc which has led to an expectation from customers for better service delivery.

However, there is some truth to this statement as many studies show that children who had a grandparent before they were born tend to be slightly less aggressive and more cooperative with strangers compared to those whose parents were present during childbirth.","While this is generally true for younger generations of men, there has been research showing that women tend to prefer male grandchildren over female great-grandchildren. This may be due to the fact that women have evolved to prefer sons (who can provide care for them) over daughters (which they must raise themselves). However, as both males and females age, their preferences often change so that they no longer prefer certain gender or generation.

However, I believe there is more to being a priest than just their beliefs or lack thereof. A good priest should be able to connect with anyone regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. They should be humble, honest, empathetic, and most importantly they should be a person of God. This last part means so much because we all need someone who believes in us to help lead us out of our darkness into the light of God's love. So while I do not agree with some of the rules and regulations set by religions for living life, I still consider myself a member of the church of Christ (the body of Jesus) because of my relationship with Him through His ordained leaders.","As a man, I also feel this way.  I am not religious or moralistic but I do believe there is an element of truth in both.  Nun's can indeed be overbearing at times with their rules and regulations which can lead to people thinking they have to follow them just because they are a nun.  However, being a nun does allow you to get away from society's norms and expectations for behavior.  It allows you to focus on your faith more freely than if you were going to work every day or go to school.

The good news here is that these kids grew up knowing that their moms were remarried and now live on their fathers side so they've already adjusted to this new situation. I would recommend trying to work out solutions together rather than getting frustrated because they aren't acting like you want them too act.

Additionally, there's nothing wrong with wanting to be surrounded by people that look like you so much as preferring people of all shapes, sizes, colors, etc., just because you happen to find some similarities between yourself and another person does not mean you should discriminate against them simply because of their appearance.

His leadership style has been described as ""hands off"", where he lets others take care of things while he focuses on making money.

However, they may be missing out on what could be considered ""the best day of their life"". The decision to have a wedding should never be taken lightly as this is a significant event that will shape your lives forever. It's important to consider all aspects when planning such an occasion. For example, you can ask yourself if having a traditional ceremony with a cake cutting and guestbook signing would suit your personality better than going for a more modern approach like a groomside shoot. You also need to think about how much money you want to spend on your big day: there are many options available at different price points but ultimately it comes down to whether you feel you can afford them both. If so, then go ahead! But don't forget to enjoy every moment because weddings are meant to be memorable ones.","Boring weddings can be very stressful, especially if you don't have any idea on how many people will show up or what kind of attire they would prefer. Boring also implies that there is no creativity involved which may not appeal to everyone. On the other hand, a fun and exciting wedding requires more planning and preparation but can still deliver an amazing experience for both bride and groom. It's important to remember that your guests come from all over the world so make sure to provide them with ample time to travel to your destination. Also ensure that you hire a professional event planner who has extensive knowledge about local customs and traditions. Last but not least, try to stay positive throughout the process as things won’t go exactly according to plan.

However, because men produce less estradiol (the female version of testosterone), they need to take higher doses of synthetic estrogens called ""androgens"" to get the same level of strength and muscle mass as women. This is why most men who engage in manual labor also consume large amounts of alcohol.","androgens, or male hormones, play an important role in human development and function. They also affect muscle mass, bone density, hair growth, skin texture, metabolism, libido, aggression, memory, mood, and many other aspects of health and well-being. Androgen levels vary by sex, age, body size, and genetic makeup; however, most men have some level of testosterone in their system. Testosterone is primarily produced in the testes, where it helps regulate sperm production. It can also be found in small amounts in the bloodstream of women who have ovaries. The amount of testosterone present varies among different individuals based on factors such as age, weight, genetics, lifestyle choices (such as diet), and medical conditions. Low levels of testosterone may lead to symptoms including decreased muscle mass, low energy, depression, thinning hair, and changes in facial features. High levels of testosterone, meanwhile, can cause symptoms such as increased muscle mass, better energy levels, improved moods, more aggressive behavior, thicker hair, and larger penises."

However there has been significant progress made recently with regards to mitigating climate change. The Paris agreement was signed by 195 countries which committed themselves to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing the impacts of climate change. This agreement commits each country to taking specific actions such as increasing energy efficiency, investing in renewable energies and promoting carbon capture and storage technology. Additionally, many companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have also announced plans to reduce their carbon footprint through various initiatives. Despite this, extreme weather events like hurricanes Harvey and Irma clearly demonstrate how little we know about climate change and its effects on our planet. We must continue to work towards finding solutions so that we can protect ourselves from further devastating natural disasters. Thank you for your question sir!","yes, indeed! unfortunately this lack of progress has been due to several factors: first and foremost, there was not enough political will from governments around the world to take action on climate change; secondly, many scientists were reluctant to speak out against each other over differing opinions about how best to tackle the problem (this is known as ""scientific"" or ""peer review""-based bias); finally, technological limitations meant that existing solutions for reducing carbon emissions had significant drawbacks - such as increased energy costs and reduced crop yields. however, with time and continued global collaboration, these challenges can now be overcome. here's why: although scientific consensus remains divided regarding the most efficient way forward, recent events have shown us just how much people care about the issue of climate change. by harnessing the power of social media, politicians across the globe have taken unprecedented steps towards addressing the threat posed by greenhouse gases. in particular, the election of president elect trump was met with widespread protests and outrage throughout the US, which ultimately led him to pledge to withdraw his administration's support for fossil fuels. similarly, the gilets jaunes movement in france saw millions of citizens come together to demand better public transportation and cleaner air, leading their elected officials to introduce measures aimed at curbing CO2 emissions."

They fed us, clothed us, educated us, etc...  They also paid our bills so they could focus their energy on raising children. Over time as we got older we started doing more and more things ourselves which included paying our own bills. This was not always the case however - many people still relied on others (parents or spouse) to financially support them throughout life. As technology has improved over the years we've become much more independent and now rely heavily on computers/phones/tablets to help us manage our finances. We no longer ask our spouses or parents for money because we know they will spend it wisely and put it towards important things like supporting themselves and their family. However, there is still a large gender gap with regards to financial management. Women tend to rely on their spouses significantly less than men do while men tend to rely on their parents significantly less than women do. Because of these differences women often feel responsible for providing financial support to their families whereas men may be relying on their parents to provide that support. When women start expecting their partners to",This is an interesting question and I don't have an answer but here's my take on this:

Headmasters also need to be reasonable since they will interact with students on a daily basis so they should act accordingly. However, if headmasters become too strict or unreasonable then this can lead to student resentment as well as low academic performance among students. Therefore, it's important for them to strike an appropriate balance between being strict but not too strict and being reasonable but not too reasonable.","Headmistress is usually overbearing, demanding and unreasonable.

They also often feel closer to god when they're younger so this could help them connect with him/her. Finally, there's evidence that suggests boys who grow up in religious households tend to be less likely to commit crimes later in life compared to those from non-religious homes.","Young women who enter into religious life as novices typically feel called by God to join this order, which is why there are so many stories about teenage girls being chosen by God to take vows.

If they don't fulfill their role properly, it will have an impact on their kids' behavior. However, there is no one-size fits all solution when it comes to parenting. Each family has different circumstances that require unique solutions.","I don't have any scientific evidence supporting this claim but I do believe that there is some truth behind it. As a child growing up with an abusive mother who was frequently absent and unable to provide proper care or guidance, I developed many of my own coping mechanisms which included substance abuse, poor eating habits, and low self-esteem. These behaviors were not only detrimental to my physical health but also contributed significantly to my mental health as well. It wasn't until after years of struggling on my own that I finally sought help from a therapist who helped me recognize how my past experiences had shaped my present mindset. Through therapy, I learned ways to better cope with stress and anxiety such as meditation, exercise, healthy diet, and cognitive restructuring techniques. In short, I became more resilient and less susceptible to negative thinking patterns because of my difficult childhood. While these lessons may seem obvious now, they weren't common knowledge when I first started experiencing difficulties. However, through continued struggle and research into the field of psychology, I've been able to share these tips with others so that they too might be empowered by their struggles rather than become further victimized by them."

It can also help create stronger relationships between the family members as they grow up. On the other hand, if your spouse works outside the house then he/she will have more time to spend with you as a parent which could lead to some potential downsides such as less communication between the two of you.","It depends on many factors, but generally speaking staying at home and taking care of your family is an important role that women should play. It's not fair or just to expect men to take time off from work to spend time with their families. This is especially true when there are children involved as they require more attention than adults do. Additionally, studies have shown that having both parents participate equally in child rearing leads to better outcomes overall for children.

Moms expect their househusband to be able to multitask, handle all of the household responsibilities while still being available for sex (or at least an adequate facsimile thereof). Housewives on the other hand have realistic expectations that their housekeeper will take care of these tasks and provide them with enough time to spend together as a couple.","Dads perceive that housewives will be more amenable and less demanding of their time, as compared to housekeepers who may not be fully committed to taking care of the home front while also being responsible for childcare responsibilities themselves. Housewives have traditionally been seen as ""good enough"" mothers who take on household chores so they can focus on running the home. Dads feel this is an easy compromise given women's innate nurturing qualities which make them well-suited to provide emotional support and guidance to children. Conversely, many dads believe that housekeeping requires much higher levels of skill and expertise from both the female member of the team (the cleaner) and the male member of the team (the dad). This perception could stem from the fact that men historically spend far less hours at work per week than women, making it harder for them to dedicate sufficient amounts of time to maintaining a clean home environment. In addition, there has been a recent increase in cases where fathers are accused of domestic violence against their wives due to these differences in gender roles."

However, even with these caveats, increased C-Sections have been shown to increase rates of both maternal morbidity and mortality. This has led many countries to mandate more invasive procedures like C-Sections when necessary. While this may seem like a good idea at first glance, it actually increases risks to mothers and their babies by forcing them into situations they were not prepared for, undermining their ability to make decisions about childbirth. In addition, while C-Sections do allow for easier access to emergency care should complications arise, they also remove options for natural birth which may result in worse outcomes for both mother and baby. Overall, mandating more C-Sections does not improve either maternal or infant health but instead creates new harms. Therefore, we believe that mandating more C-Sections would likely cause more harm than good.","Despite the obvious benefits of increasing parental care, some people argue that policies requiring larger caesareans for babies is unnecessary and will only lead to more cesarean births which can increase risks of complications like postpartum depression and uterine rupture."

Headmasters have an important role to play in educating girls so that they make good citizens of our country. They also need to set clear rules which everyone understands and follow. If there is no way for them to do this effectively then we will end up with chaotic classes where some students try harder than others because they feel like they can get away with things while the teachers struggle to keep control. This would not benefit anyone - neither the teacher nor the student. In fact it could even harm both as the students might lose interest in class if they see no point or value in what is taught. On the other hand, if the school has a reputation for being difficult and unruly places where students fail to learn anything due to lack of effort from those who actually put in the work (the hard-working ones) then that would reflect very badly on the headmaster and her staff. So my answer to your question is: yes, they should be more understanding but no, they shouldn't be less strict.",yes but they also have an obligation to protect students from harm and that's not always possible with such rules

She will likely be older than most people in the congregation so that they can look up to her wisdom and experience. An abbess should be someone humble, loving, patient, and encouraging all while being firm when needed. The key here is to show grace towards those who make mistakes and encourage them instead of punishing them harshly. This will go a long way in helping build a culture of humility, love, and patience within the church you lead.","Abbot is not a real human being, but rather a fictional character from the medieval Christian book ""The Holy Bible"".  In this story, Abbot Augustine was a holy man who lived during the time when Jesus Christ was on earth.  Augustine saw that many people were living for worldly things instead of focusing their lives on God.  He decided to live simply by giving away all his wealth and property so he could focus solely on serving God.  This inspired other wealthy men to follow his lead.  Eventually, this led to the founding of monasteries where monks would dedicate themselves to prayer and study while forsaking material comforts.  These days there are still some religious orders which practice this type of lifestyle.  However, I am unsure if any modern day abbots exist as they seem to have given up their riches in favor of pursuing holiness."

In fact, many of the most prominent female leaders in finance have done so successfully. For example, Christine Lagarde served as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund from 2013 until she was appointed by President François Hollande of France as his Minister of Finance in May 2016. She has since been elected president of the French Financial Markets Association (AFM) for a two-year term beginning January 2017. Her appointment followed the resignation of Michel Sapin, who had held the position since 2012. Christine Lagarde's predecessor at the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, also became famous when he was arrested on charges related to sexual assault. He subsequently resigned from all positions and went into hiding before being charged with criminal sexual act. Despite these setbacks, both men were eventually acquitted of all charges against them.","While this may be true, there is no question that Warren Buffett has thrived as an investor and business leader throughout his lifetime.  His Berkshire Hathaway portfolio includes many businesses which have been traditionally dominated by men such as railroad companies, insurance companies, and utilities.  Buffett's success can also be attributed to his ability to identify undervalued assets and invest in them for long periods of time.  He famously bought Goldman Sachs back from its original founders at a discount when other investors were selling out of the company due to its poor performance during the financial crisis of 2008.  This type of investment strategy has allowed him to build up these businesses over the years through buybacks and dividends while maintaining a large percentage of his net worth into investments outside of these companies.  In summary, I believe that successful businessmen can succeed in any industry but they must focus on investing across multiple industries rather than focusing only on their core business."
