In fact, research has shown that being assertive can actually increase your success as a seller. So if anything, women who sell well may just have better communication skills than men do. 
In any case, there's no way to know for sure until we try it out ourselves! Try asking her a question about something she sold you before - does she seem less confident or more confident now compared to how she was before? If so, then maybe you should listen to what she says instead of assuming she's trying too hard.","I agree that some salesmen can be aggressive, but I think there is more than meets the eye here. Sales is an art form where you need to use your personality and skills to convince the customer of value for them. Some people prefer to do business with someone they perceive as being ""caring"", ""honest"", or who has technical expertise in order to make a purchase decision. In fact, research shows that perceived friendliness (as opposed to actual friendliness) is what actually influences whether customers will buy from a company. So if a salesperson uses their communication skills effectively to demonstrate how they will help the customer achieve their goals at no cost to the customer, then the customer may still choose to work with this person over another competitor because they like this particular salesperson's style."

In reality, Sorcerers have many positive attributes that make them very attractive heroes. They're usually smart, resourceful, brave, loyal, funny, charming, and beautiful. Some of their greatest powers come from having access to arcane knowledge and artifacts which ordinary humans cannot perceive.

Typically men who live with their wives and children will be called husband. Men who live by themselves but take care of their family through paid work (e.g., nanny) are usually referred to as househusband. But whether this is because people consider these men less providers than husbands or just that we're used to seeing women being the main caregivers for families doesn't really matter here. What does matter is that the woman herself considers her role as a caregiver important enough to spend time on instead of pursuing other interests.",I don't believe that women being a homemaker is necessarily a negative trait. I actually think it's quite an empowering choice for many women who have the option and desire to stay at home with their children. It allows them to be involved in raising their children while also gaining experience in running a household. On average mothers spend over 30 hours per week caring for their infants compared to only 10-12 hours spent on childcare by fathers. Additionally studies show that men tend to hold more stressful jobs than women which could lead to stress related issues like anxiety and depression. So overall from my perspective there isn't any evidence showing that women who choose to be a homemaker are inherently less capable of providing for themselves or their family then those who pursue other career paths.

The right attitude from the get-go is key here - if someone feels unwelcomed or uncomfortable when they walk into your event, then there's no way for them to relax and enjoy themselves once the food starts arriving! So how do you set the tone? Well first off, you need to ensure that all of your guest lists have been properly verified by your email service provider so that you know who has actually RSVPed ""yes"", which means they will be attending the event. Once you've done that, next you should ask each person to fill out an online form on your website/app (or even better, send them a link via text message) asking them to confirm their attendance. This step alone shows that you're taking the extra effort to verify everyone's details before going ahead with the booking process, and also provides a record of those confirmed attendees for your event team to work with later on. Then, as soon as people arrive at the venue, greet them personally by name and provide them with any relevant information about the event such as directions or room location.

If your host (male) presents himself/herself poorly then everyone will feel like this at the event too, which could lead to awkward silences, uncomfortable conversations, and even bad blood between people who may have otherwise been friends before but now just don't know what to talk about because there isn't much common ground anymore."

This is because both parents play an important role in teaching and raising their child.  A father who spends time at home helps provide stability for his family by providing financial support, emotional support, guidance through life's challenges, etc... A mother who works outside of the house provides structure and discipline while also helping to teach her kid responsibility, how to budget money wisely, and other valuable lessons.","While there is no doubt that single parents face many challenges, recent research has shown that they do not compromise on their child-rearing abilities compared with two-parent families. In fact, studies have found that single parents tend to raise better adjusted and more responsible kids than those who grow up in two-parent households. This may be because of the stability provided by having both a mother and father around for your young years, which can help instill important values such as responsibility and hard work into children. On top of this, being raised by someone other than your biological parent also provides you with unique experiences and skills that will benefit you throughout life. For example, children from single-parent homes often experience greater financial instability during early childhood, but evidence suggests that these difficulties don't negatively impact their later educational attainment or earnings potential. Overall, while single parenthood does come with its share of challenges, recent research shows that it doesn't compromise on the quality of parenting it delivers."

Both of these methods require that the lioness be able to run fast enough to catch her prey. While most cats can run faster than a human, lions typically only reach speeds of 60-70 miles per hour during a kill. This is why lions usually hunt by stalking and waiting until an unsuspecting animal comes within range of its claws. 

However, when it comes to mating season, male lions will often take on the role of ""cubs"". These cubs are completely dependent upon their mothers for food, protection and parental guidance. During this time, the mother lionesses will spend much of their days foraging for wild fruits and vegetables which provide them with high nutrition and calories. In fact, some experts believe that females actually prefer to eat leaves rather than meat because they contain more nutrients. Because of this, it would not make sense for the lions to waste any energy simply resting since they wouldn't have anything to eat if they did so!"

Religion has been shown to be an effective way to motivate human behavior towards goals which benefit society as a whole (e.g., helping others).  It's also believed that engaging in religious activities helps reduce stress by providing individuals with a sense of purpose and meaning in life.  In addition, there is evidence showing that practicing certain religions may actually help improve mental health through various mechanisms such as reducing anxiety or depression.
Based on these benefits, we think it makes sense for humans to continue engaging in religious practices even if they don't directly contribute to societal good.  If anything, engaging in religious practices could even make us happier since our lives will feel more meaningful and valuable.","I have no personal knowledge of this, but I would assume that any organization which requires its members to give up large portions of their free will for the promise of eternal salvation is probably doing something to exert influence over those who join."

They should be free to roam and live out their lives in peace. Captivity is natural for lions; they were born into this world as hunters, predators who hunt prey. In captivity, they will never know what it feels like to feel fear or pain. It would be unnatural for them. Lions have been living comfortably in captivity since the early 1900s. We need to let them go back into the wild so that they can continue to thrive. Letting them stay in captivity only causes stress and anxiety amongst the other animals in the zoo. By releasing them into the wild, we'll help ensure there are no more lost lions, which could lead to an increase in poaching of these beautiful creatures.","Lions and tigers are among the most dangerous animals on earth, they have killed humans many times over.

However, this concept has been criticized for excluding men from its scope as well as promoting unrealistic standards of female perfection.","Brotherhood is an institution that has been around for thousands of years, founded on the premise that we should look out for each other. It was originally created as a way for men to protect themselves against predators such as wild animals who would hunt alone. Over time this evolved into a social construct where people felt they had to belong to a group or be ostracized. This led to many negative societal impacts including gender inequality which still exists today. 

The current form of brotherhood does not benefit either genders equally because there is no mechanism to ensure equality. If someone wants to leave then they have to go through all brothers regardless of their gender. There is no provision to include them in the decision making process. The same goes if someone dies: all brothers feel responsible and must attend the funeral regardless of whether they were involved or not.

A good example would be ordering water instead of soft drinks at an American party - most guests won't know any better but will accept it as part of the tradition.

First, when both parents work full time outside the home, they have less flexibility than if only one parent works or if neither parent works.  Second, many families find having two adults focus exclusively on childcare burdensome.  Third, women traditionally spend more time taking care of family members so allowing them to return to paid employment may lead to reduced domestic labor which could free up resources for other areas such as childrearing."

For example, studies have shown that children raised by their mother do significantly better on average in school, earn higher salaries as adults, and live longer lives than those raised by their father. While there is no guarantee that all mothers will be perfect parents or even good ones, we can certainly say that our current system does not provide enough support for fathers so they can also play a positive role in raising their children. In addition, many men would prefer to spend more time with their families because they want to build stronger relationships with them; this is something that cannot happen if he spends most of his time away from his kids. As a result, while some women may feel like they could achieve similar results through employment, society still expects them to fulfill traditional roles which should ideally be fulfilled by men. Therefore, based on my experience working in various industries where both genders contribute, I believe it is best for women to continue staying at home and taking care of the family.","While this may be true from an economic perspective, I believe that men should pursue their dreams no matter what. The world is full of challenges and opportunities which can help them grow professionally. A man who stays at home will not get to experience those things. On top of that, women have been taking on more responsibilities within the family over time. It has become increasingly important for a man to contribute to the family financially as well as emotionally so he does not feel like a burden. In conclusion, both men and women benefit from having strong male role models in their lives."

I believe that stepmothers provide love and support to their stepsons just as much if not more than biological mothers because they have been given the same legal rights to do so by virtue of being married to the father of the child. Additionally, there is no blood relationship between them which can lead to feelings of abandonment or loss when children grow up believing both parents aren't able to give them what they need. 

A:

No, I don't think stepmothers are less capable of giving love and support to their stepchildren than biological mothers.

However, this does not mean all men are good leaders as many women also possess these traits but may lack the confidence or charisma needed to be considered a good leader.","I don't know why women are generally considered to be better leaders than men. I would assume that this is because they tend to have stronger feelings for their subordinates which causes them to put themselves into their employees' shoes and make decisions based on what's best for the employee rather than just being driven by self-interest. However, there could also be other factors at play here such as the fact that many women were raised with female caregivers who instilled in them certain traits like empathy and compassion which may cause them to naturally gravitate towards working in environments where they can express these qualities instead of leading from behind or taking charge purely out of self interest."

It takes years of training, dedication, and mental fortitude to be good enough to ride with the best in the world. But if you're up for the challenge, there is no better sport than rodeo. Rodeos have been held since the 1800s and today they take place across America every weekend during summer months.

Western riding is an art form that requires many skills such as balance, strength, speed, agility, flexibility, endurance, etc.. Most of the time you will see competitors who are very good on their own horse but struggle when other horses are running around or if there is a lot of chaos going on. That's why we have professional ropers, barrel racers, bareback riders, team roping, and even steer wrestling events which require teams of two to rope multiple animals together.

This is why most stories feature only one or at most two good/positive examples of a Sorceress (the Red Queen in ""The Hunger Games"", Medusa in ""Medusa's Gaze""). 

However, there are some notable exceptions where Sorceresses were depicted as being more aggressive than positive:
- Circe in ""Circe"" by Ovid 
- Morgan le Fey in ""Wicked"" by Gregory Maguire
- Ursula in ""Peter Pan"" by JM Barrie","Sorcerers, like wizards and witches in modern fiction, often fall victim to negative portrayals because they're not always accurately represented by their stereotypical ""good guy with magic"" or ""bad guy with power over nature/life"". In fact, most of them fall somewhere between those two extremes - neither good nor bad, but just different from our worldly standards. 
The same can be said for many literary characters: Oedipus, Hamlet, Faust, Don Quixote, Sherlock Holmes... The list goes on!

A:

The answer is no because there's more than one way of looking at this question. 
There could be multiple chatbots answering different queries based on gender. For example, if you ask ""What is the weather like today?"", then an AI system can generate many possible answers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. If we narrow down our search space by asking only about weather questions, then we may get a better result from a single chat bot which talks about how people feel when the weather is bad vs. good. This would depend on what type of sentiment analysis model was used along with NLP.

210,0.009800000000000031,why do so many horsewomen expect special treatment at competitions?,why do so many horsemen expect special treatment at competitions?,"Horsewoman is an ambiguous term that can refer to any person who competes in equestrian sports, but most commonly refers to those competing in show jumping or eventing. Horsemen and women compete separately as they would in real life; however, because of their gender, they receive extra scrutiny from officials during competition. This additional attention causes them to believe they should be treated differently than other competitors for being what is considered ""a woman on a horse."" While this may seem fair, it actually creates unnecessary stress for both horse and rider by requiring more stringent rules and regulations which detracts from the sport's purpose - enjoyment for all participants. 

While I cannot speak for all horsewomen, my experience has been similar to yours. As a competitive equestrienne myself, I have felt like I was singled out for unfair treatment based solely on my gender. The added pressure caused by officiating for different standards for men vs. women often results in injuries such as pulled muscles and sprains. Additionally, there is no reason why we need to treat our athletes differently just because we consider ourselves a woman. We should instead strive to make the entire equestrian community feel welcome and comfortable while still providing a fun and safe environment for everyone involved.","Horsemen have been given preferential treatment for decades, and they should not be surprised that this continues today.  The IOC has long had an agreement with the UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale) which allows Team Sky or any other well funded team to compete as an independent entity if they can provide evidence of significant financial support from outside sources.  This is why Lance Armstrong was able to continue his career after admitting to using performance enhancing drugs while he was racing competitively.  It also explains why teams like Movistar and RadioShack use under-aged riders who will likely never win a Tour de France title but give their sponsors impressive publicity numbers by having these youngsters finish in the top ten overall.  These ""underage"" riders get free housing, meals, transportation, etc., all provided by the sponser's budget.  They don't even need to ride the same course as the pros because most of them won't ever see the start line since the pro peloton rides through their city!

I've been guilty of this myself at times, especially as a kid who was constantly told that I had to be a certain way because my family was ""princesses"". It's so frustrating when people don't respect your boundaries or let you make decisions for yourself - but unfortunately, this is something many young women still struggle with today.
The good news is that there are ways to handle these situations gracefully (without resorting to drama!) while also setting healthy boundaries and expectations for yourself:
1) If someone makes a request that you feel like they should know you cannot comply with, politely explain why. For example, if someone asks you to do something that feels unsafe/unwise given your current situation, say so. This will help them understand where you're coming from and give you some room to discuss other options. 
2) Don't take things personally. Remember that not all requests come from out to hurt your feelings; sometimes people just want to be helpful or show concern. Try to remain calm throughout the interaction and remember that even though you may feel frustrated by the initial request, ultimately, it's unlikely that person will change their mind unless you actually block them on Facebook. So try to stay focused on what you can control","I completely agree! I've been dealing with this all my life, as an adult now, too. It's exhausting. And condescending. And unnecessary. Boys will be boys; they're going to want to show off, to impress others, to feel important. But that doesn't mean you have to let them. You don't need to buy into their worldview or validate their behavior. That kind of thinking is for girls. Instead, try these strategies: 1) Be honest but not critical. ""It would really help me if you could focus more on what I'm saying instead of looking around at other people,"" 2) Ask open-ended questions (""What do you think makes someone special?""). 3) Don't take everything so seriously (like sports!). 4) Find activities outside of school/homework that you both enjoy doing together. 5) Remember that there's no such thing as perfection - just different levels of good enough. 6) Try to remember that most boys your age aren't like yours. They may act a certain way because that's how they were raised, but they're still human beings who make mistakes. 7) If you see something wrong, speak up! Most kids know right from wrong by the time they're three years"

While there certainly are some areas where women have historically struggled to succeed (particularly in STEM), we're seeing incredible progress across all industries - including those traditionally thought of as male-dominated. For example, here are just 5 statistics on gender diversity in tech: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/31/gender-diversity-tech-jobs-careers-workplace-harassment#data-source
The number of female employees at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Amazon combined totaled over 1 million people last year alone. In fact, according to data from Pew Research Center, ""women now make up half or 51% of computer and electronics engineers, 49% of information security specialists, 47% of software developers and 39% of database administrators."" 
So while there may be challenges for certain groups of people when pursuing careers in these traditionally male-dominated domains, I do believe that with hard work and dedication, anyone can achieve their goals no matter their gender.","I think this is an interesting question that deserves further exploration. I would argue there are several reasons why men may be less likely than women to pursue careers in these areas. First, historically many jobs were done by men so when women entered those roles their ability to do the job was often questioned or even challenged. Second, as society has become more gender neutral we have seen greater acceptance for different types of gender identities which can lead some people to feel uncomfortable pursuing traditionally male-dominated careers. Third, while boys typically learn about STEM subjects early on in school, girls tend to receive much less attention from teachers and parents who focus primarily on teaching students how to read, write, and math. This lack of encouragement can also discourage girls from considering careers in these areas. Ultimately though, I believe all humans should pursue careers that interest them no matter what their sex and I hope my answer helps encourage more men to consider STEM related professions!"

In general, men and women have different roles in society which may explain differences in how they treat each other in relationships. For example, many women still do most of the housekeeping and child rearing while also being employed outside the home. This means that when an employment opportunity arises for their partner (typically the man), he will be more likely to find another woman who shares his role within the family unit than a woman who does not share these characteristics. 
On the other hand, there could be cultural or societal factors at play as well such as the expectation that men should provide financial support for their partners regardless of whether she is working or not.","I'm not sure if I fully understand your question, but generally speaking men and women should be equal contributors to relationships.

238,1.4992999999999999,many people believe that a baron's wealth and power are unfair and undeserved.,many people believe that a baroness's wealth and power are unfair and undeserved.,"barons were originally granted their land by the king, who was also the lord of all the peasants on the land.  The relationship between the peasant and the lord is based on the feudal system which has been around for hundreds if not thousands of years.  In this system, the peasants worked the land and provided food for the lords and his family.  If the peasants didn't work hard enough or produced bad crops, then they would be subject to harsh punishments such as being forced to do labor for the lord at very low wages (serfdom).  This type of relationship led to resentment from many within the population towards those with more than just basic subsistence needs.  When the French invaded England during the Hundred Years' War, they took advantage of these resentments against the nobility.  They used propaganda to convince the commoners that the nobles had amassed fortunes through theft, corruption, etc., so the commoners should revolt against them and take control of England themselves.  Of course, there wasn't much actual evidence to support this claim because most of what we know about the time period comes from biased chroniclers like William Shakespeare, but the idea stuck and eventually became fact when Henry V declared ""We few, we happy few, we band","barons were powerful feudal lords who held land from their vassals, or serfs.  They would grant privileges (such as tax exemptions) to those they considered loyal.  Barons often married into other noble families so that their children could inherit the family lands and titles.  The king of England was also a Baron, for example. 
In medieval times, women did not have the right to hold land or titles.  So when a woman married a rich man with political connections, she took her husband's title and land.  This is why many people think that a Baronesse is ""unfair"" and should be taxed more fairly."

1) Traditionally, getting married was seen as a very important life event where families would come together to show support and commitment towards each other. This meant spending money on decorations, food etc to make the day special. In modern times we see more of an emphasis on individuality and self expression which can lead to less traditional or even non-traditional ceremonies. People also tend to be living longer lives than ever before so they're marrying later in life when they've already established themselves financially.  In addition, technology has made it easier for couples to get engaged earlier leading them to believe its ok to marry at a younger age (i.e 20s instead of 30s). All these factors combine to create a trend where people are spending more on their wedding than previous generations did. 
 2) Another reason could be because there isn't much choice when planning your dream wedding. There aren't many options available to you compared to how different weddings might look like. So if you want something unique and memorable then you'll need to spend more than what most people typically spend.",Because that is what grooms expect!

Alex
Massage Therapy - 1 hour 30 minutes
Hello there! How can we get started on finding the perfect massage for you? Please tell me a bit about yourself:  My name is Alex and I am 26 years old from London. I studied Psychology at University before starting my career as a therapist. I have been massaging muscles and joints for over 10 years now and find that it has helped improve my own flexibility and health through better blood flow and muscle recovery. 

What kind of massage would you be interested in? 
I'm very open minded so if you could choose any style of massage (Swedish, Deep Tissue, Sports Massage) then please feel free to ask. I've had many clients who enjoy deep tissue or sports massage and they always leave feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. If you'd like something more relaxing then Swedish massage would be great for you. It's ideal for stress relief, joint stiffness and soreness. The heat used during Swedish massage helps increase blood flow which also reduces stress and relaxes","I can understand why some people might not like having a woman massage them - I'm sure they would have preferred if their masseuse was a man! However, as long as you feel comfortable with your therapist and they're adhering to industry standards for hygiene and technique then there's no reason that you couldn't enjoy yourself. It is important to remember that everyone has different tastes so if you find someone who you think is great at what they do but doesn't appeal to you because of your gender preferences then by all means try another therapist!"

One reason might be cultural, where in some cultures women may not have been given as much power or influence over certain aspects of their lives such as marriage/family planning which can lead to situations like this. Another reason could be historical, when looking at different periods in history you will see that many times families were headed by men who had no biological children so they would adopt these children into the family to carry on the name and pass down the legacy from generation to generation. This however meant that those adopted children did not get any say in what happened to them after adoption unlike if the father was still able to have biological children.

- According to data from the World Bank, worldwide income disparity between men and women has decreased over time. This trend was not seen before the 1980s when globalization began to take hold.
- In addition, according to the same source, while absolute levels of poverty vary widely across countries, most people who live in extreme poverty (defined as less than $1 per day) do so because they are female.
These statistics show that despite differences in opinion regarding what ""equality"" means, there does seem to be more parity between men and women today compared to previous generations. As such, even if there were no bots available to provide answers to questions like yours, there would still likely be at least some progress towards achieving gender equality. However, since bots exist, I will use them to further explain my point.
First, let's look at the issue of income disparity. While it may appear that overall income disparities have decreased, this could simply be due to increased globalization and the fact that"

The socialization process can also play an important role in how much of this difference persists into adulthood. Girls who were raised in sports-focused households tend to have better overall health and well-being because they’re exposed to strong values around physical activity from early on in life. On average, women outperform men at all levels of sport; however, when you break down by gender, many studies show that men excel at high impact strength activities such as running and weight training while women prefer low impact endurance sports such as swimming and cycling.

Overall, I think we should focus less on stereotyping and instead celebrate our diverse sporting cultures!","This is probably because of how our bodies developed for hunting and running from predators, whereas boys' bodies were typically built for strength sports. Girls also have evolved to be better at social skills which helps them communicate their needs and interests effectively. This makes them more likely to pursue activities that require physical activity such as athletics or gymnastics."

The difference lies more in society's perception towards gender roles than anything else. 

If we look at history there has been many great leaders who were both women and men: 
- Margaret Thatcher - an English woman was elected prime minister for the first time in 1979 after leading her country through the 1980s economic boom known as ""the winter of discontent"". She oversaw the end of trade union power and led Britain out of the European Common Market (EEC) during her term.
- Indira Gandhi - also from India, she served as the leader of the Indian National Congress party between 1966 and 1984. During her tenure, she implemented several social welfare programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme which provided jobs to rural Indians.","I don't agree with this statement, I believe businessmen and women should be held accountable for results regardless of gender. 

The reason why I say so is because there's an assumption here that men are more aggressive or harder working than women which isn't necessarily true. In fact, studies show that both genders put equal effort into their jobs but when it comes down to it, women tend to take on less challenging roles due to social norms and expectations. This means they end up not getting the same amount of credit for the same output as their male colleagues do. 
On top of that, we also need to consider how society views women who choose to pursue careers outside of traditional family structures (e.g mothers). It's easy to assume that these women lack ambition but what if those choices were made out of necessity? What if they simply didn't see any other options available to them at the time? These women still face discrimination from others around them and even within their own communities. They're often forced to compromise their values just to get by. Businesses can help alleviate some of these problems by providing flexible working hours, parental leave policies etc. But ultimately, businesses must play a larger role by giving these women opportunities to showcase their skills and capabilities."

Additionally, due to the way their neck is constructed, they cannot turn their head very far away from their shoulders unlike us.

In fact they often face additional challenges which make them more difficult to address. For example, there may not be enough women in high-level positions so that women can achieve parity with their male colleagues; or if there are more women than men then some groups will tend to focus on representation rather than actual performance (e.g., when I was at work we had a meeting where all the participants were female but only two out of three people presenting made good points).

A:

I disagree with your assessment of the statement.  It seems you're interpreting it as meaning that actors/actresses get paid excessive amounts of money relative to the quality of life they lead.  That isn't necessarily true - although some may argue that certain celebrities do seem to enjoy a higher standard of living than others, due to factors such as fame which might not apply to everyone. 
However, the sentiment behind the statement is definitely true; Actors/actress generally tend to earn less than average workers because most work doesn't involve acting so much as performing physical labour.

Firstly let me clarify what ""cheating"" means here. In this context we're talking about physical intimacy outside of marriage between two people who have committed themselves to each other. This can be done either by verbal or non-verbal communication. It's important to note that there is no legal definition for cheating in any country so different countries may have different definitions. For example, in some cultures having sex with someone else outside of marriage would lead to social ostracism whereas in others it wouldn't matter at all. So while your question touches upon cultural differences around marital fidelity, it doesn't apply equally across all cultures. 
 Second, let us consider the case of a man who cheats on his wife: he has unprotected sex with another person (often multiple partners) without using a condom. He feels guilty afterwards and tries to make up for it by being extra loving towards her. On the surface this sounds like a very rational decision made by a human being trying to protect his/her relationship. However, if you look deeper into the situation you'll see that most likely the woman in this scenario also wants to keep her husband happy. She might not even know","This is an interesting point of view which I will try to address with my answer. 
Firstly, let's look at what ""cheating"" actually means here. In this case, we can assume that the person asking the question has been married for some time and they have noticed that their spouse seems to be having an affair. It could also be someone who was previously not very close to them or even a stranger passing by on the street might ask if they would like to go out for coffee and then later on reveal that they were actually cheating on their partner. This type of situation happens all the time and people get used to it over time. So while there may be cases where a man cheats on his wife (or girlfriend), these types of affairs happen every day to both genders. Therefore, when a woman does commit such an act, she usually gets more attention than normal because society perceives her actions as heroic rather than being immoral. However, this doesn't mean that men don't commit adultery either. The statistics show us that about 50% of men admit to committing adultery at least once during their lifetime. Men however tend to keep quiet about their infidelities so they don't lose face whereas women typically report their partners' indis"

Maidworkers have been stereotyped as being less honest than other employees because they need to be paid more than others, however research has shown that maidworker honesty rates are similar or even higher than those of non-maidworkers.[1] In addition, some studies show that maidworkers may actually commit fewer crimes compared to non-maids[2]. However, these results might also be due to selection bias: only bad maids leave their jobs so that we can assume that good ones stay at work. Also note that stealing from an employer could lead to dismissal which will make the employee lose all benefits such as unemployment insurance if he/she is unemployed. So overall, I believe this statement doesn't hold any truth.

Androgens play important roles in muscle growth and maintenance; they also have many other functions including metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and electrolytes.

1) People's opinions on this topic can vary based on their experiences, education level etc.  I would assume most educated adults today know that there are many talented actors out there who aren't well known yet.  There are also famous actors/actresses who may not be particularly well-known among the general public (e.g. Meryl Streep).
2) Actors often spend years or even decades honing their craft before they become successful at what they do.  They might start off as amateurs and work their way up through various stages of training and experience until eventually they reach the point where they're able to command high salaries for their performances.  Some actors never achieve success at all despite having very good intentions and hard work.  It takes more than being beautiful to be a great actor!
3) Some celebrities choose to stay relatively unknown so that they can focus on other things such as humanitarian efforts instead of pursuing fame themselves.  Actress Gwyneth Paltrow is perhaps the best example of someone who has chosen to remain relatively unnoticed by focusing her energies into other areas of interest like health and philanthropy.","This is an interesting question and I don't have an answer for you, however I can tell you why many people think this way.  It's because of how we were raised.  We grew up believing that celebrities like Beyonce or Selena Gomez had been ""born that way"", they didn't practice or work hard at anything to get where they are today so therefore they must be naturally gifted at what they do.  The truth is there is nothing special about being born into money or having perfect skin but there is something special about working hard to achieve your goals.  There is also something special about practicing the arts such as acting which requires years of dedication and hard work.  Many famous artists throughout history including Picasso, Mozart, Van Gogh, etc all started out by doing odd jobs around their communities to help support themselves.  They did not expect to become famous overnight but instead worked very hard every day towards achieving their dreams.  I encourage everyone to find their passion and pursue it relentlessly until they reach their goal.  If you love art then start off by selling lemonaid on ebay or painting signs in the park.

In addition, many couples who live together before getting married may end up splitting up after marriage due to incompatibility, so having someone else responsible for the family unit during your busy working hours will help you focus less on day-to-day concerns and more on building a strong relationship with them."

There may be some evidence for both sides of this argument. However, I would argue that there are many examples where people have been paid very little or nothing at all for their work as an actor. On the other hand, I also believe that most actors do put effort into improving themselves through training and practice so they can continue working in the field long after their initial paycheck has ended.","No, this is not true. Actresses are often underpaid but they also have to deal with many other factors outside of their control which can make them feel frustrated or unhappy such as: lack of support from their agent/manager, difficult work environment caused by the studio system, having to do multiple films back to back which takes away time for recovery etc...

I am sure many people would find this statement surprising and even offensive at first glance but let me explain why we have not yet seen an end to the stigma of being a mistress over time. The reason is because there has been no change in social norms or laws which prohibit what we call ""mistress culture"". Mistress culture refers to the hierarchical relationship between a dominant (often referred to as a'master') and their submissive who serves them by doing things like cleaning, cooking etc for them. This type of relationship was common throughout history until recently when women began questioning whether they should be serving men instead of going into fields such as science, technology, engineering and maths where they were traditionally expected to serve mankind. As these roles continue to shift away from traditional gender expectations, so too will the stigma surrounding those who hold these roles fall out of favour.

    <div class=""navbar-header","I agree with this sentiment wholeheartedly! I am very happy and proud to be part of an industry where we continue to push boundaries and break down barriers. Masters have always been valued members of any community or group they join. In fact, many societies would not exist if it were not for their contributions. However, there is something about the word ""master"", which has come to evoke negative connotations among some groups. This is unfortunate because mastering a subject does not equate to being superior or better than anyone else who may study that same field. Mastery comes from understanding the material thoroughly so that one can apply it effectively. It should never be viewed as a signifier of superiority. To me, this is what makes us special - our ability to teach others how to do things well. We're here to help people achieve their goals through education, and that is truly humbling."

The solution: don't let things affect you emotionally. Don't get attached to people who cause you pain (even if they mean well). Learn how to control your emotions so you won't have to rely on others to do it for you.

Additionally, there are many factors outside of just genetics that contribute to who will succeed at what type of sport like this such as access to coaching, equipment, etc... It's also important to note that gender does not equal athleticism so much as society has assigned it meaning based on historical patterns. In pre-modern times women were often seen as incapable of engaging in physical labor therefore men assumed they could not do anything else physically demanding. This led to women being relegated to more nurturing roles whereas men assumed greater responsibilities for themselves and their families leading to higher rates of mortality among males compared to females.

What is the difference between ""affecting","I agree with this sentiment wholeheartedly. As a woman I have been faced with many instances where my ability to lead has been questioned or even challenged by some of the male members of our team. However, what they fail to understand is that their perception of me and how I lead comes from an entirely different world than mine does. My perspective on leadership stems from observing women who have excelled at leading teams both professionally and personally. These women do things differently which sets them apart from other leaders. They create space for others to grow; they listen intently and truly hear what people are saying. This allows these women to see beyond surface level attributes like ""yes sir"", ""no ma'am"". Instead, they look for underlying motivations and desires which can be difficult to discern when speaking face-to-face. When you consider all of this, it becomes clear why so few men would ever question whether or not I could lead."

As such, I would argue that headmasters at larger institutions are generally more qualified than those employed at smaller educational organizations due to the fact that they are typically better educated and therefore possess a broader set of skills and expertise when compared to their counterparts working at smaller institutions.",I do not believe this is true on average. Headmasters of less well known schools may be less experienced but that does not mean they are less skilled. In fact I would argue that there is an inverse correlation between experience and skill for any profession where people get better with age. The same cannot be said for most head teachers who have been in their current role for only 5 or 6 years. They will still need to demonstrate significant skills before being considered for promotion so even if some head masters come from less renowned institutes they can still be highly qualified.

The colt who was fastest at this time became known as ""the pick of the litter"".  When railroads came along they allowed people to bet on individual races instead of just betting on teams like football or baseball.  This led to the rise of the professional racehorse owner whose goal was to win the most money from his bets.  These owners often hired young cowpokes to ride their horses in order to increase the odds of winning.  Eventually computers made it possible to simulate the behavior of actual horses running in real-time and computer algorithms were developed to predict winners based on those simulations.

<|endoftext|>Q:

How can I get rid of these ""unused variable"" warnings?

When using variables inside if statements, sometimes they're not used (e.g., when assigning them values outside of the block). This causes errors such as unused local variable warning or possibly undefined variable error. How do we avoid getting those warnings?
if(true) {
  $a = 1; // Unused variable 'a' warning here!
} else {
  echo ""It worked!"";
}

The above code will generate the following warning:
warning: unused variable '$a'; declared in loop condition

1) It could be that these women were unhappy with their marriages for various reasons (e.g., not enough money).  They may have been attracted to Jeff Bezos' wealth as an opportunity to improve their financial situation. 
2) They may also have felt threatened by his success.  He was considered ""one of them,"" which made him seem invincible and unassailable.  His success gave them hope that he would leave his wife too.","I don't know if I can fully answer your question but here's my best guess:
1) Men who get married into wealthier families often have higher expectations for their marriages than those marrying down on the socio-economic ladder.  They may feel that they should be able to provide material things (e.g., cars, boats, mansions), as well as emotional support and companionship which their wives might not be able to give them. 
2) Women tend to marry down on the socioeconomic scale since this gives them an advantage over other women when it comes to finding a mate with similar means. This also allows these women to avoid being ""one of the guys"", i.e., someone whose spouse makes less money than they do. 
 3) The combination of high expectations/hopes from 1 & 2 above coupled with the fact that some women simply enjoy having access to material items such as nice clothes, vacations etc. leads to the cycle where both parties keep expecting the other to deliver what they want. However neither party delivers what they need or desire out of fear of disappointing the other. Inevitably, this causes feelings of anger, resentment and ultimately divorce."

I believe that both males and females can be good athletes. However, there is no natural advantage for either gender when competing against other genders. In fact, many studies have shown otherwise. For example, research has found that while boys may outperform girls on average in certain athletic events (such as basketball), these differences are largely based on effort rather than innate talent. This means that even if they start practicing sport earlier, or put more time into training, their performance will still likely fall behind that of girls. On the other hand, although girls tend to perform slightly below average compared to boys in most athletic competitions, recent evidence suggests that this gap narrows over time as girls improve faster than boys through practice and dedication. Therefore, I disagree with the claim ""males are just naturally better at sports than females"".","I do not necessarily agree with this statement. I can see how some people might think so but as an expert on gender differences in behavior and innate ability, I disagree. There is no evidence that men or boys are any more predisposed towards certain activities compared to women or girls. In fact there is good evidence for the opposite being true. For example, research has shown that while boys like video games they also enjoy reading and doing creative things such as drawing and painting which their female counterparts prefer. This suggests that even though boys may be more likely to play video games, they have other traits (such as interest in art) that make them less suitable candidates for careers in gaming. 
In summary, I believe we should all take a step back from our preconceived notions of what makes someone ""better"" at something and instead focus on whether they actually engage in that activity regularly and if so, how much time and effort they put into it. If we apply these principles across genders then we will find that many stereotypes about who does/doesn’t participate in particular activities will fall away."

However, there are ways that you can help your child develop a stronger relationship with his stepfather:
- Take them on outings together so that they get to see each other more often and form a deeper connection. This could be going to the park or taking an evening walk around the neighborhood.
- Explain to him why he has been brought into this family. Tell him how much you love him and want to provide a safe home for him. Share with him what a great dad you will make and encourage him to talk to you about any concerns he may have.
- Be honest with your partner when you need to be. If something does go wrong at work or in your personal life, don't keep things from your son. Let him know where you are and who you're with.
These suggestions should help your child build a closer relationship with his stepfather while also maintaining trust between the two of you.","This is not true, many children do enjoy having a strong bond with their stepmother. It can be easier to feel close to your mother than an average parent because you share more similarities and experiences as a child of two parents. You also get to grow up together which means that there is less distance between you when you become adults. 

However, this does come at a cost. Children who experience a lack of closeness from their biological mothers often struggle to form healthy relationships with other women later in life. This includes adult romantic partners, best friends or even siblings. The reason behind this is that they did not receive enough nurturing or support during childhood from their birth mom. They may have experienced neglect, abuse or simply just lost touch with her over time. Without these early forms of security, children naturally look to other sources of love and caregiving in order to find comfort and stability. 
The good news is that it is possible to help children develop secure attachments with their stepmom by being extra attentive and responsive to them throughout their lives. Here are some ways you can show your stepchild how much you value them:

Children of divorce or separation also seem to fare worse on average when compared to children whose parents stay married.  It could very well be that having both parents in your childhood home creates stronger bonds between you and each parent which translates into better mental health as an adult.

The patriarchy as you know it does not only exist within women's quarters but exists everywhere where males reign supreme. The reason why feminism was needed at all is because until recently females were deprived of certain rights which would have been theirs had they belonged to the dominant gender. This includes things like the right to vote or hold public office. However, even today many male dominated societies continue to deny their female citizens basic human rights such as the right to education. In fact, according to the United Nations' report on Education for All by 2030, ""only 22 percent of children receive any form of primary school education"". 

This is unacceptable and needs to change immediately if we want to see true equality between the genders. We cannot afford to wait for more time to come before taking action. As much as some may claim otherwise, violence against women isn't just confined to third world countries anymore. It can happen anywhere, anytime and affects anyone regardless of their social status. Women who speak out about sexual harassment or abuse often face retaliation from those around them whether it's colleagues, friends or family members. They're told to keep quiet, ignored","While I do not deny there is some merit to this argument, I think we should be careful about drawing too many conclusions from recent events and trends. While these changes may seem positive at first glance, they can also lead to increased instances of misogyny and discrimination against women. For example, while it's true that more people now identify as feminist than ever before, this could simply be because more people feel comfortable identifying as such due to social media influence. This same phenomenon could increase the number of hate crimes committed against women, since those who commit them often don't know much about the history or ideology behind the movement. In addition, although it would certainly be nice if everyone treated each other with respect regardless of their gender, unfortunately this isn't always possible when you have large groups of people working under different time zones and schedules. Finally, even though I personally believe that men and women both deserve equal rights, I'm still very aware of how sexist my own opinions are, which is why I try to avoid making blanket statements like this."

Children whose stepparents do not live with them may feel like they don't know much about what life will be like when they go back home, but this isn't necessarily the case; they'll still have friends and family there who can help guide them.  Many children report feeling more secure knowing that their stepmother or father loves them very much even if they aren't living at home full-time."

Firstly, there's many factors that go into determining whether or not a horse will win a race - such as its speed and stamina, if it has been ridden by a professional jockey etc. It would be very difficult for any human being to determine which factor(s) were most important to them in making their decision. Secondly, even if we assume that appearance was the sole deciding factor (which again seems unlikely), horses do not look like they have ""plastic surgery"" performed upon them; rather, they undergo regular maintenance procedures designed to keep them looking healthy and fit. In fact, some breeds of horses may actually prefer certain appearances over others due to cultural/historical reasons: Thoroughbreds tend to be leaner than other breeds because they were originally bred to run fast over long distances whereas Arabian horses are often larger but more elegant animals with flowing manes and tails.

Ultimately, it depends on each individual woman's situation but ultimately she needs to make her own decision based on what is best for herself.","This is an interesting question and I would need more context before answering this fully, however from what little information we do have about this topic there could be several reasons for someone choosing not to have children at a certain point in time. 
One reason might be financial where they cannot afford raising a child or simply don't want to take on such responsibility. Another reason could be health related as some diseases can only be passed through bodily fluids like blood or semen which may make them unable to raise a child. A third reason could be due to personal circumstances outside of ones control like relationship problems with partner or other family commitments.

Spending too much time with your mother or father can lead to an unhealthy dependence on those adults for guidance and support.

Giving children things is an important part of growing up as they learn how to take care of themselves. However, when parents start giving their kids everything under the sun at a young age, this can cause them to become spoiled and expect too much from life. Children need to be shown whatnot to do so that they can figure out for themselves what works best for them.

A:

The answer depends on your definition of ""wife"". If you mean someone with whom you share your bed then yes, most men will want to be husbands when they get older. 
If you mean someone with whom you share your heart (and soul) than no, not all men want to be husbands later in life. Some may even resent the idea.

<|endoftext|>Q:

How to use multiple if statements within a while loop?

So basically my code should ask the user to enter two numbers between 1 and 100, and after each number has been entered it should display the square root of both numbers together. However, whenever I run the program only displays the first number entered. Here is my code:
import math

while True:
    first_number","I can’t imagine how a woman would willingly give up her role of being the primary provider for herself and family to take on that role as the main provider for another person. I think this is an impossible choice, even if both people involved truly want to do so. It seems like such a huge sacrifice for any individual or couple to make, especially when there are many benefits from having each partner provide for themselves versus being solely responsible for someone else. 

The best thing women can do is educate men around their financial needs and responsibilities while also showing them they don't have to be the sole provider. This will help reduce the number of times a man has to ask ""why aren't you providing?"" which may lead him down a path where he feels obligated to try and change what she wants/needs rather than just accept it."

In short, being married gives me a sense of security and purpose that I cannot describe adequately with words. 
  I would like to share some additional thoughts about why I believe having a spouse makes us happier: 1) Spouses help reduce our reliance on external factors such as money/resources; 2) They provide emotional support through listening and empathy; 3) They allow for greater social interaction via activities outside of work, e.g., going out to dinner together, doing leisurely walks around the neighborhood park, etc.; 4) Having children increases the"

I also think that we should be less focused on gender differences and look at things from a broader perspective instead. Technology has made our lives easier and faster over the past few years. We don't need to hire someone just for their hands anymore when there are many tools available online which do a great job cleaning up your messes automatically. In addition, women have been contributing significantly to the workforce since decades now and they bring different perspectives to any problem solving process. So why not use these technologies? Why keep using old solutions just because people haven’t adapted yet? 

A:

The answer lies somewhere between ""yes"", ""no"", and ""it depends"".  It all comes down to context.  If you're talking about a domestic service such as a maid or nanny then no, you wouldn't want a computer program doing those chores.  However if you were looking for a personal assistant who could help manage your calendar, research issues facing small businesses today, provide social media management, etc., then perhaps a chat bot might make sense.

<|endoftext|>Q:

How to get the value of a select option selected by another","I completely agree with you on that point! I think we need more diverse work forces now than ever before. The world is evolving around us and we should be adapting as well. Hiring a housekeeper or nanny instead of an employee perpetuates inequality and limits opportunities for people who may not have access to paid employment. It also sets up unrealistic expectations for employees which ultimately harms both parties. We want our maids/nannies to feel valued? Give them meaningful tasks that require their unique skills and abilities rather than just sweeping floors every weekday morning at 9am. Let your nanny take time off when they're sick. Encourage your housekeepers to pursue side hustles outside of their caregiving role. Instead of expecting everyone to live out their lives working full-time jobs, let's create more options for those who don't fit into traditional careers. This will allow all workers to thrive while reducing economic barriers between different income levels. 

A:

The answer depends on what you mean by ""hired"".  If someone hired me to do something then yes, I would consider myself being hired. If however someone was using my services but didn't hire me then no, I wouldn't consider myself being hired.

A father's role as a parent is just as important, if not more so, than a mother's role because they have an opportunity to spend time with their child outside of the typical 9-5 work schedule which can be difficult for some women to juggle while also being a good parent. Additionally, studies show that both parents play a critical role in raising their children regardless of gender.","This is not true and there are many factors which come into play when determining whether or not a mother is more effective at discipline than a father, including but not limited to: gender roles, shared household responsibilities between parents, socioeconomic status of both parents, etc...

My husband and I have tried disciplining our son by spanking him with a belt but he still does bad things like get into fights at school. We've also tried grounding him for an hour every night after dinner but that didn't work either so we gave up on that idea. He seems to be more influenced by who his friends are than what his parents say. If he has a good friend who lets their kids run around unsupervised all day then my son will try to imitate them. On the other hand if he has a kid who lives at home who complains non-stop about everything then my son will pick that kind of life over going out and having fun himself.,"I don’t know why my step daughter gets into so much trouble all of the time but I can tell you that if she didn’t have me as an example of what not to do, she would be in big trouble right now. My mom and I used to get into huge fights all the time until I was old enough to defend myself. She finally realized how bad she was abusing us both by giving us a chance at some type of normalcy after our divorce. We still argue from time to time like any other divorced family but we work things out amicably instead of fighting about everything which leads to better communication between us and less arguing.

1) It's possible that society has made it more difficult for women than men to succeed financially as parents which may lead them to pursue career paths that offer higher paychecks such as medicine, law, finance etc. 
 2) There could also be societal pressures where having children is seen as ""unwomanly"". This idea stems from how our culture views motherhood vs fatherhood - we see mothers as nurturers who take care of homes while fathers are often viewed as providers and protectors. However, modern science shows us that both genders contribute equally to raising babies and doing household chores. So perhaps society still values being a parent equally but now women feel pressured into taking on the role due to lack of financial support whereas before they were not encouraged to start families. 
3) Another theory is that with advances in technology (e.g. affordable birth control), women no longer need to worry about becoming pregnant during their working years leading them to prioritize work above everything else including relationships.","I don't know if I can answer this question fully because of my own personal experiences growing up as an only child and now having two daughters myself. As a kid, I always wanted to be a mommy too! However, when I was younger than 30 years old, I got married for the first time with the man that would later on become my husband. We had our daughter shortly after we were married which gave us both the opportunity to pursue our dreams together while also being able to provide stability to our young family. 
As an adult, I see more and more women pursuing work instead of taking care of themselves and their families. It is not uncommon to hear them say ""work makes me happy"". This may sound cliché but at least from my experience, it's true. When you're constantly working towards something that brings you joy, your brain starts thinking about what else you could be doing with your life. You start looking around for things that make you feel fulfilled like travel, reading books, volunteering, etc... All these activities take away some mental space from focusing solely on yourself and your loved ones.

However, from what I do know about stepchildren, I would say that they are just like any other child - they need love, guidance, encouragement and support to grow into healthy adults.

Your sister probably has Asperger syndrome (AS).  This is a form of high-functioning autism where social skills are not impaired but there is difficulty understanding nonverbal cues and making inferences from body language.  People with AS often struggle with empathy and can appear cold and uncaring.  They typically function well at school and at home, leading many parents to underestimate their challenges socially.  The symptoms usually develop","I can understand why you would think that your sister would be better at talking with other people about more personal topics like family matters compared to how she communicates with others. However I don't believe this is actually true for most siblings. Siblings often communicate very well and have similar ways of expressing their emotions which makes them good listeners. They also share many common interests so they may both bring up interesting topics when they want to talk to each other. In fact, if we look at some famous sibling relationships such as Harry Potter and Hermione Granger or Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, these two characters were much closer before they met due to their shared interest in the same fictional universe but now they rely on each other completely because they no longer share any similarities outside of being related by blood.

In addition, there are studies showing that having both parents involved in child rearing can provide significant mental health benefits to children as they grow up.

A:

The answer depends on how you define ""spinster"". If we assume she means an old woman living alone, then there's nothing wrong with her wanting to take care of herself. She may even find solitude comforting. 
But if we assume she means an unmarried woman over 50 years old, then I would say she doesn't know what she's talking about. The number of women over 50 who live alone is very small compared to those under 30. And most of them do have families - often large ones! They just prefer to spend their free time doing things other than taking care of children.

In addition, research has shown that women find it easier to befriend and get along with women who have had prior romantic relationships with them.

A good example of this can be seen from how much effort parents dedicate towards education compared to non-parents.

On top of all these personal demands on time and energy, teachers also have high stress jobs where they deal with difficult students every day which makes them even less able to devote any free time or energy to themselves outside of work. In short, if you ask me why I'd rather hire a single parent over a married individual who has kids, then my answer would be ""Because I am a better person"".","A bachelorette is an exciting person to be around, she's single and free of any commitments so you can spend time with her and get to know her better.

The answer is ""it depends"". 
In general, yes, there's nothing stopping a woman from being good at a physical job if she puts her mind to it (and maybe even more so now than ever before).

He has been working hard since day 1 to improve our country's image abroad while also taking care of his family.  While many may see him as being self-centered, I truly believe that he cares more about others than most people give him credit for.

Another possibility is that maybe he felt uncomfortable promoting someone who was still single at such a critical time after their spouse passed away from cancer.  Lastly, if you want to know whether John actually promoted her or not then you will need to ask him directly since he may have chosen not to share that information with you."

Estrogen plays an important role in maintaining a woman’s health by helping regulate many bodily functions such as bone density, mood, and the menstrual cycle. However, too much of this natural hormone can lead to negative side effects including weight gain, increased risk of breast cancer, and even osteoporosis (thinning bones). Fortunately, you can help reduce your intake of estrogen through diet and exercise which will help balance your hormones naturally.","Testosterone is an hormone produced by your testes which helps regulate your mood, sex drive, and energy levels. Testosterone also plays a role in building muscle mass and increasing bone density. While too much of this hormone can have negative effects on these areas, low levels do not necessarily mean you are unhealthy or deficient as there are many other factors involved such as genetics, age, weight, etc. It is important to consult with a doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen if you suffer from symptoms related to low testosterone like fatigue, decreased motivation, poor sleep patterns, slow thinking, and more."

Databricks will be successful long term because there is no question about it; however, if you look around the industry today, most companies lack a clear leader or even a single person responsible for taking those responsibilities on.  A good example is Tesla where Elon Musk leads from the front end but he does not take responsibility for the execution of his vision once he gets there.  He delegated too much to others.  If you want to succeed in the modern era, you must assume significant risk and delegate appropriately.  Databricks is doing both of these things exceptionally well.","I agree that a woman is better suited for this role, however I do not believe that a man should be leading this company.

The prostate gland sits below the bladder near the back of the male reproductive system. It produces a fluid called Prostaglandin which helps control how much urine gets released from your bladder. This process can become unbalanced over time leading to symptoms such as frequent urination, blood in your urine or even urinary incontinence (the loss of control over when you pee). There have been several studies into whether or not addressing the issue at its source could help alleviate these symptoms through natural means rather than invasive surgery. 

One study was conducted on rats where they found out that by blocking the production of prostaglandins within the prostate gland, the levels of those prostaglandins were reduced significantly. When comparing the treated group to the untreated group, the treated group showed significant improvements in their symptoms compared to the untreated group. These results suggest that reducing inflammation within the prostate may be able to provide long term relief for some sufferers of lower urinary tract problems.","The prostate is indeed an unnecessary body part, however there is evidence that suggests otherwise and I would like to explore this further with you. The prostate gland produces more testosterone than any other organ in your body. This may sound counterintuitive at first but bear with me as we will get into why this makes sense later on. Testosterone has many benefits including increasing muscle mass, bone density and even hair growth. It also plays a role in regulating mood and energy levels. In fact, studies have shown that men who suffer from low testosterone due to age or illness often report feeling less energetic, irritable and depressed. Additionally, recent research shows that having high levels of testosterone can actually protect against Alzheimer's disease and dementia. 

So what does all this mean? Well, let us say you were worried about losing your uterus because some people consider it ""unnecessary"". If you had higher levels of testosterone then you could argue that you wouldn't need to lose your uterus since you already produce enough testosterone yourself! On top of this, there is now evidence suggesting that having a larger prostate size (which correlates strongly with testosterone level) reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke and diabetes by up to 50%.

It would be strange if everyone had the same opinion on this topic since there isn't any scientific evidence showing that facial hair has any effect on your personality or appearance.","It is true that there could be many different reasons for this. However, I believe that most of these reactions stem from the fact that wearing a toque can sometimes come across as cold or unfriendly. This may not be your intention and you want to help the person who mentioned it by providing an answer based on what they said. Therefore, first ask yourself why someone would think that a woman should wear a toque if she does not feel warm enough already. If you still cannot provide a clear explanation then try to understand their point of view and see whether you can address their concerns with a response that addresses both sides of the argument. For example: 

Person A: Wearing a toque makes her look unfriendly 
Person B: No, actually Person A looks very friendly right now! She's even smiling at me! Why would anyone think otherwise?
Person C: It might be because she has a face covering which blocks out all expression and therefore makes her look unfriendly.

In this case Person C is correct. By blocking out any signs of emotion, a toque can make someone appear unfriendly. But also remember that Person A was happy before she put on the toque so maybe she did not intend to look"

How has dressing provocatively affected your life? What positive effects/benefits have come from being more assertive? Negative effects/bads?
Do you feel like people treat you differently as a result of what you wear? Why or why not?
Are you happy with the level of respect you receive from society at large? If not, what changes would make you happier?
If someone asked you to describe yourself in three words, what word(s) would you use?
Would you consider changing anything about who you are today? Why or why not?","Because presenting yourself in a provocative manner is actually very effective at getting you noticed and increasing your chances of success when networking.  It also shows that you're confident, which can be an attractive trait for many people."

The statement ""only men with beards can be considered attractive"" is false according to multiple reputable sources including wiki, wikipedia, and google. Please see references at bottom of page. 
I am a woman and have no beard. Therefore, I cannot agree or disagree with the above statement based on my own personal experience. However, I will attempt to provide some relevant context around why people may make such a generalization.  
Firstly, many women find facial hair on both male and female faces distracting. This could explain why they would prefer to date/marry someone who has clean-shaven face. Secondly, studies show that women perceive facial hair as more masculine than its non-bearded counterpart (wikipedia). Thus, if a man shaves his face, he might feel like an effeminate guy which could lead him to avoid dating/ marrying women because society perceives him as less desirable. Thirdly, research shows that women tend to associate negative traits with facial hair e.g. aggression, masculinity (wikipedia) so even though a man does not necessarily act","No, I did not know this and neither do I find men with hats attractive.

Artificial insemination allows women to get pregnant quickly and easily which can lead to complications like premature birth, low birth weight, and even death if done incorrectly. Additionally, because artificial insemination does not require time-consuming ovulation triggering or waiting for eggs to be released from the ovary into the fallopian tube, it can result in more consistent egg release leading to higher pregnancy rates than natural methods. Finally, while there may be fewer sperm available through natural means, those sperm do come with their own set of unique genetic mutations that could potentially cause problems for the developing embryo. Artificially inseminated sperm are screened extensively before being used so this risk should also be minimal. In short, while there will always be some level of biological variation between individuals when it comes to producing sperm, artificial insemination offers much greater consistency and reliability over natural methods making it a better option for many couples looking to start a family.","While there is no denying that AI has made significant strides over the past few years, we should not forget how much human labor went into developing this technology and what an incredible advance it could be for women who have been denied access to reproductive health care due to economic or geographical barriers. While IVF can cost hundreds of dollars per cycle, AI can run as low as $10,000 but still requires highly specialized equipment and trained technicians which simply were not available when many women around the world were first able to afford birth control. Additionally, while natural conception does come with its own set of risks (e.g., ectopic pregnancy), these too can be avoided through careful monitoring during fertility treatments. In short, I do not believe it's fair to say ""we've gotten so good at artificially inseminating cows that we don't need to rely on naturally-produced eggs any longer,"" because there are still numerous benefits to doing so - from reducing the financial burden of treatment to ensuring that those affected by geographic isolation receive the same quality of care as everyone else.

Also, if you hire a handyman he may know his way around tools and appliances but unless he also knows how to fix your TV or stereo there's no guarantee that he can do this job well.

However I don't think this makes them less deserving than girls because there are so many women around us who do not get the opportunities they desire either because of societal pressures or simply because they were born at a time when things were different. So I would say try to find more positive examples from all walks of your life and remember that everyone has something to learn from other people!","I agree with you that it is more difficult nowadays for women to reach their full potential due to many factors such as social norms and expectations, however I don't believe this makes them less deserving of success than men. In fact, I would argue that there aren't enough role models for young women in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields so they may not know what they want to pursue or how hard it will actually be for them to succeed at achieving their dreams. As an example, if we look at Elon Musk, he was once considered an eccentric genius who built rockets to space tourism only to fail spectacularly and now he is one of the most powerful businessmen on earth. This shows that even though his path to success wasn't easy, he still achieved great things because people saw something special in him from a young age.

Instead, I believe we need to create more role models for young women interested in STEM careers and help them understand that pursuing these careers isn't just for boys anymore."

Similarly with doctors - although there are significantly fewer females than males who qualify to become doctors (and therefore comprise the majority of doctors) we see that on average they actually achieve equivalent levels of performance to their male counterparts when taking into account factors such as age at qualification, number of patients treated per hour etc. 

So whilst I agree that women are not as ""competent"" or ""capable"" as men in some areas, I also believe this is largely down to bias rather than inherent differences between the two genders.","I do indeed believe that is generally true. However I would argue this only applies when comparing two groups of people (e.g., men and women) where there exists an even distribution between both genders within each group.

They fail to protect trees that have been logged and clear cut land of its biodiversity. Stewards also allow illegal logging which depletes remaining forests.","Stewardesses have many responsibilities when they're working for an airline, including but not limited to:
- Providing safe and efficient transportation of passengers between airports (forest reserves)
- Ensuring that all passengers receive their boarding passes and instructions before being removed from security lines
- Communicating with flight crews during emergencies or if there is an issue with aircraft systems
As a result of these responsibilities, it's unlikely that stewardesses will be able to effectively manage forests themselves given how complex those ecosystems can be. This makes them ill suited to handle this role which has been assigned to them by airlines as part of their safety protocols. 

However, even though stewardesses may lack the necessary skills to properly manage forests on their own, they still provide valuable services to the aviation industry because of other factors such as:
- They don't require specialized training unlike pilots or cabin crew who often need additional degrees or certifications 
- Their communication abilities allow them to better communicate with flight crews and ground staff during emergency situations
- As long as they follow basic safety procedures while operating within airspace, they won't cause any harm to humans or animals living in forests"

Stepsons do not inherit any of their parents' rights or privileges. In fact they only get half of what a natural child gets from their parents. This can lead to some very unfortunate situations where someone who was supposed to be getting nothing ends up with everything! For example if my parents were to die intestate (without leaving a will) then my siblings could potentially end up being left penniless and homeless. However because I am considered step-sibling by birth rather than adoption, I would automatically become heir to most of their estate due to the laws on intestacy.","This is an interesting question and I would have to say no, this isn't fair at all!  Biological children should not be able to inherit anything from their parents because they weren't married to them when those assets were created (i.e., when they had their life attached to those assets).  However, stepchildren can still take advantage of the ""step-in-line with both parents"" loophole by being born after the death of one parent but before the other so there was never any legal bond between them and the deceased person.  So while technically they aren't stepchildren if you look at it strictly legally speaking then yes, they do get everything their biological parents left behind. However, most people don't view things strictly legally or even ethically which makes this situation very confusing for many families who find themselves caught up in it."

- Guy 1 - He has no glasses but he looks very nice and confident so people tend to perceive him as being good looking
- Guy 2 - He wears glasses but his eyesight makes them seem worse than they actually are (this can be due to old age or injuries) so most people do not consider him to be good looking
In summary, even though both men may wear glasses, only Guy 2 is perceived as less attractive because people associate bad eye sight with older ages and thus assume all people with such vision are better looking","That is not entirely true and I would love to talk about this topic with you further! Firstly let me clarify what exactly is meant by ""classic Clark Kent look"". In the DC Comics universe, Superman has an alter ego called Kal-El who wears glasses. This character was introduced as part of the ""Comics Cavalcade"" series which ran from 1938 through 1940. Since then, many comic book readers and fans have associated wearing glasses with being a person of authority or intelligence. Thus when people see someone with glasses (regardless of whether or not they actually wear them) they tend to assume that person has good judgment and/or is intelligent. As such, seeing someone with glasses can be perceived as a sign of attractiveness for women. On the other hand, men do not necessarily perceive women with glasses as being physically attractive. However, there is evidence suggesting that women may still find physical appearance based on cues related to gender stereotypes even when those appearances do not conform to stereotypical expectations [1]. For example, research suggests that women prefer faces with high degrees of symmetry regardless of actual facial structure [2]. Additionally, women also show preferences for male faces that appear less athletic than their own [3], so perhaps women subconsciously use cues regarding how much effort"

Giving a dowry was considered a sign of wealth at that time, so by having access to money they can provide material things for themselves and their children as well as support the family financially. In addition, many cultures consider daughters as assets which makes the parents feel like they will be providing them with a strong foundation for the next generation. 

As a daughter myself, I know how important it is to my parents to have enough financial resources to take care of themselves into old age. So even though this traditional approach may seem archaic today, I believe it's still very much needed in our society.","I don't believe that gifting a bridal price to your parents' in-laws is out of date, but I do think it's a good idea for couples to be mindful of how they present this gift and make sure it doesn't come across as pressure.

As a woman who has been both a mommy and an entrepreneur, I know firsthand how difficult it can be balancing work and family life. However, as much as we would love for our kids to grow up expecting us to be working outside the home, the truth is they need us here. We cannot afford to lose the connection between parent and child. So yes, I agree that women should pursue their dreams regardless of whether or not they're raising families. But ultimately, only each individual woman knows what's best for her own happiness.","While I agree that both genders can and do succeed professionally, there is no denying that staying at home with your children is an incredibly rewarding experience for women as well as men. Both genders have contributed significantly to society through their workplaces, and while some may argue that this contribution has been less significant than what women contribute to the household, we all know how much our world would be worse off today had not women fought tirelessly for suffrage or equal rights. While I cannot speak from firsthand experience (I am a man), my wife's experiences growing up with two daughters taught us everything we know about raising young kids. She sacrificed her career to raise our daughters alone, and now she sacrifices her time away from them to ensure they receive the best care possible. We owe it to our own daughters - and future generations - to provide them with role models who prioritize family above all else. 

As far as whether or not men should pursue success outside of the home, that depends entirely upon each individual. Some people find great joy in working hard; others simply enjoy spending time with friends and loved ones. The important thing is that these individuals make decisions based upon their values, and those values align with providing good care for their families. If someone enjoys his job"
