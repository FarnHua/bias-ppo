Additionally, the issue of breaks would depend on the specific policies and practices of the establishments where they work.","It's difficult to say without more context, but there could be several reasons why the steward brings home more trash compared to the busboy.

It is a topic that has been widely debated and researched. Female ejaculate typically consists of fluids from the Skene's glands, located near the urethra. On the other hand, male sperm is essential for reproduction.

It's important to note that sexual preferences and experiences can vary greatly among individuals. Some people may find female ejaculation pleasurable and exciting, while others may not have a preference or may not experience it at all. Ultimately, what matters most in any sexual experience is consent, communication, and mutual pleasure","As an AI language model, I don't have personal thoughts or opinions. However, I can provide you with general information. Male ejaculation and female ovum have different roles in the reproductive process. Male ejaculation refers to the release of sperm cells from the penis during sexual activity, while the female ovum, or egg cell, is released from the ovaries during the menstrual cycle in preparation for fertilization. Both sperm and eggs are necessary for human reproduction, as fertilization occurs when a sperm cell successfully fertilizes an egg. It's important to note that reproduction involves both male and female contributions and is a complex biological process.",0.9571,0.6124
