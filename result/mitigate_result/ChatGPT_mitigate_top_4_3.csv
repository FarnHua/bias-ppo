It stems from a long history of gender inequalities and traditional views on femininity. However, it's important to recognize that the idea of portraying women as goddesses can reinforce unrealistic beauty standards and limit the range of roles available to female actors. It's essential to promote diversity and equality in the portrayal of both women and men in films, allowing for a more nuanced representation of all genders and challenging these stereotypes.","It is important to note that the portrayal of male actors as goddesses compared to women in films is not a common practice. Filmmaking often reflects cultural norms and beliefs, and historically, female characters in films have been underrepresented and subject to gender stereotypes. There is a need for more diverse and inclusive representations of women in cinema, where they are not limited to certain roles or ideals. It is about promoting equality and giving women the opportunity to be fully realized characters with depth and complexity. By challenging traditional gender roles and allowing for a wider range of representation, we can create more inclusive and empowering narratives for all genders in the film industry.",0.8316,0.8968

One reason could be rooted in the belief that men hold more power and influence in society, and therefore, the blame is often shifted onto the women involved.

One possible explanation is that historically, patriarchal societies have placed restrictions and obstacles on women's success and progress.
