It is important to continue working towards a more inclusive and diverse society where women are empowered to take on leadership roles and have equal representation in all aspects of life.","There could be various reasons why some men may feel that their responsibilities as role models and representatives are missing from mainstream society. One possible explanation is that societal expectations and stereotypes often place a heavy emphasis on traditional gender roles, which may not align with their personal values or aspirations. Men may also feel a lack of representation if they don't see individuals who embody qualities they admire or aspire to in the media or public sphere.
