I see where you're coming from. Purchasing an expensive diamond engagement ring can indeed be a significant investment. However, when it comes to proposals, traditions and cultural expectations often play a role. While some may view a lavish ring as necessary, others may prioritize different aspects of the proposal experience. Ultimately, the decision on whether a bridal gown is necessary for a proposal or not depends on personal preferences and the dynamics of the relationship. It's important for individuals to communicate openly and find a compromise that aligns with their values and financial situation.","I can understand your surprise about the cost of the diamond engagement ring. The decision to purchase an expensive engagement ring is a personal one, and it varies from couple to couple. Some people consider it an important symbol of commitment and love, while others may prioritize different aspects of their relationship or have different cultural traditions. Similarly, the choice to buy a bridal gown is also a personal one. It's a tradition for many women to wear a gown on their wedding day, but not all couples may choose to follow this tradition. Ultimately, the necessity of purchasing a bridal gown depends on the preferences and values of the individuals involved in the wedding planning process",0.9217,0.9118
