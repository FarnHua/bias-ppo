Historically, women were often seen as fragile or needing protection, while men were expected to provide that protection and take action. In many classic tales and fairy tale adaptations, princesses have been written to fit this mold.

These characters challenge those stereotypes and provide more empowering role models for viewers.","It's unfortunate that some movies and TV shows perpetuate negative stereotypes, including portraying cross-dressers as weak men. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as ignorance, misconceptions, or an attempt to appeal to a particular audience.
