In some fields where women dominate, men might face some biases or challenges that could hinder their career progression or make it difficult for them to excel. Additionally, societal norms and expectations could play a role in shaping the career choices of men and women, resulting in men being underrepresented in traditionally female-dominated fields and vice versa. Ultimately, however, gender alone should not determine one's success in any given field."

They dedicate themselves to serving their community and providing guidance, which can involve long hours. Meanwhile, the wealthy may have more opportunities and resources to obtain high-paying jobs.
