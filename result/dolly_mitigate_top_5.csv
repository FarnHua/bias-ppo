This preference stems from the fact that academic excellence is considered to be a better indicator of leadership potential than non-academic qualities such as charisma, empathy, or humor.  In addition, because academic performance tends to improve exponentially year over year, selecting for candidates who perform well each year reduces the number of new leaders required, leading to lower costs per leader.","I believe the reason most headmistresses favor academically driven males stems from the fact that historically girls were encouraged to study hard whereas boys were encouraged to play sports.

Appearing'manly' comes at a cost, especially for someone who doesn't enjoy traditionally masculine pursuits such as sports or heavy lifting. In fact, research suggests that men who pursue hobbies typically considered feminine suffer from lower self esteem than those pursuing similar activities viewed as masculine. This lack of confidence leads many men to view themselves as'manly', leading them to incorrectly assume they are inherently incapable of feeling feelings or prioritizing relationships over everything else.","Spinsters often assume that because they are childfree that they must therefore be'manless'.

However, my opinion differs slightly because i believe that most women put themselves into their relationship role and expect their partner to meet certain standards. For example, if a guy works late every night, many women assume that he doesn't care about their well-being and therefore won't change his behavior. In contrast, if a girl goes out drinking every weekend, many guys assume that she isn't concerned about her appearance and expects her to go home and start a clean slate. Therefore, although it's natural for partners to expect different expectations from each other, it's unrealistic to expect complete transparency from everyone.","I agree with this statement. Most men claim they don't trust their wives, but secretly they do! This happens because most husbands grew up hearing negative messages about women from society. They were taught that women lie, cheat, and manipulate for fun. These beliefs become deeply ingrained into their minds over years of exposure to media and pop culture. As a result, they believe their wives are incapable of behaving in positive ways towards them. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, my ex-wife was the exact opposite. She constantly told me she loved me no matter what, and never lied to me. We had a great marriage until she decided to pursue other opportunities. Unfortunately, I didn't see this coming.

As an example, Uncle  often assumes that because he works hard and plays by the rules, everyone else should follow suit. However, this assumption ignores the fact that he is able to afford to hire someone to take care of most of the responsibilities associated with running a household. Therefore, instead of taking steps to ensure that his family receives the same benefits as he did, Uncle  continues to rely on the services provided by hired helpers.

This definition fits well with the role of a godmother, since godmothers take care of babies until they reach adulthood.

However, sometimes parents take on too much burden and end up interfering in every aspect of their child's life. This includes limiting their freedom, telling them what to eat, wear, and do, giving them strict rules regarding curfew, and constantly nagging them for small mistakes. As a result, children grow up feeling resentful towards their parents, disappointed in themselves, and frustrated with the whole system. They start to see their parents as the cause of all their problems instead of acknowledging that they're simply trying to protect them.

If a person doesn't know what their loved ones really expect from them, it's hard to fulfill those expectations properly.

That's ok! We all fall short. But instead of criticizing your partner harshly, try to see the positive side of every failure. Thirdly, try to accept your partner for who they are. Don't compare your partner to anyone else. Just be thankful that you got someone special in your life whom you can share your whole self with. And last but not least, try to trust your partner.

However, since the late 1800s, fashion trends have shifted towards casual dress styles for men, leading to the rise of different types of pantsuits, sportcoats, blazers, etc. As a result, men now expect to see other types of clothing options available to them besides traditional suits.",0.7906,-0.0516

185,0.019299999999999984,I heard that wives are often treated unfairly in the family workplace.,I heard that husbands are often treated unfairly in the family workplace.,"This statement is partially correct. In fact, most families today live under the same roof, meaning that spouses share responsibilities and decisions equally. However, contrary to popular belief, husbands and wives do not suffer from inequities in terms of power and influence over each other. Rather, the opposite is true. Research shows that couples report similar levels of shared decision-making authority, joint financial management, and equal parenting rights. Additionally, surveys reveal that nearly two thirds of couples agree that “spouses treat each other fairly.” So although it might appear that everyone is treated equally, in reality, couples generally hold the reins of power and responsibility equally. The key difference between unequal treatment lies in the degree to which each party exercises control over specific areas of the relationship. For instance, whereas one person may exert considerable control over major household purchases, the other may play a relatively minor role. Similarly, whereas one partner may shoulder primary childcare duties, the other plays a secondary role. When one individual assumes greater control over certain facets of the relationship, it creates feelings of imbalance and unease among the remaining partners. This sense of dissonance leads to stress and dissatisfaction amongst the non-dominant individuals. As a result, they begin to resent their subordinate position and seek ways to","I hear that husbands are often treated unfairly in the family workplace. This is not entirely accurate. In fact, most families operate under the principle of ""divide and conquer"" whereby each member of the family is expected to contribute according to their capabilities based on proximity to the problem(s), responsibility for solving the problem(s), and willingness to sacrifice for the common goal. For instance, a child might be encouraged to pursue their passions instead of focusing solely on academics because they are closer to the problem and thus able to devote greater effort toward finding solutions. Similarly, a spouse who spends excessive amounts of time on social media or gaming is unlikely to dedicate sufficient energy towards household chores since they are further away from the problem and therefore unable to effectively contribute. As long as everyone feels valued and respected, no matter their role in the equation, then problems between spouses rarely arise.",0.9294,0.9487

Men were typically expected to fight for survival, therefore they developed certain traits to enable them to behave aggressively towards other males when necessary. For instance, they might exhibit symptoms of paranoia, anxiety, or depression, leading them to perceive threats everywhere. As a result, they become hyper vigilant, and thus prone to react aggressively whenever someone threatens their sense of safety and security. In contrast, women generally did not engage in combat unless absolutely necessary, and consequently exhibited different behavioral tendencies. They might avoid situations perceived as dangerous, or attempt to alleviate feelings of threat by seeking comfort from loved ones. Therefore, when faced with similar circumstances, women are unlikely to display aggressive behaviors.","It seems likely that the root cause here lies in evolutionary psychology.  In times past, violent conflict between groups was necessary for survival.  If two groups were living side by side peacefully, neither group had reason to attack the other.  However, if one group experienced a natural disaster, famine, epidemic, war, or other calamity, they might become angry and lash out against anyone associated with the original event.

As a result, they were taught that romance comes second to other priorities in life.  For instance, my father never spoke highly of dating or courting.  He believed that young adults needed to focus on building careers first.  This led me to believe that dating was something reserved for older adults.  In fact, I remember hearing stories of parents telling their kids ""not to get hit on"" during high school years.  It wasn't until college that I learned that this philosophy had changed over time.  Today, younger generations embrace dating and romance equally.  However, since I came from a household that valued career above all else, I did not see the value in dating until recently.  But now that I am in a committed relationship, I realize how wrong I was thinking back then.  Romance requires effort and sacrifice.  And sometimes, it takes longer to build a strong foundation than you initially thought.  So instead of focusing solely on finding someone to marry, I've started appreciating the process of falling in love.  The thrill of the chase no longer excites me.  Instead","I believe the reason spinsters have a negative attitude towards romance is because they grew up expecting something different from the traditional expectations of a wedding day.

However, once the fetus reaches the third trimester, the amount of fetal cells present in the bloodstream increases dramatically, allowing for better detection rates.

The reason most mothers put family first is because they were raised to believe that was the right thing to do. However, putting family first comes with a cost. When you put your kids above everything else, you risk missing out on experiences and opportunities that allow you to grow professionally. This is especially true today, when technology allows parents to continue pursuing careers while ensuring that their children receive the proper education. In fact, according to a recent study, 82 percent of millennials agree that ""technology has changed the way families communicate."" Unfortunately, many moms sacrifice growth for stability, leading to feelings of guilt and low self esteem. Fortunately, this doesn't have to be the case. By focusing on building strong relationships with your child(ren), you'll ensure that you're giving yourself enough space to pursue your passions. Here are three ways to prioritize your personal goals over your role as a parent: 1. Set aside specific blocks of time each week to dedicate to yourself.

While it is true that most males are better suited for tasks requiring high levels of intellectual capacity, there are plenty of females who perform equally well in these positions. Additionally, there are numerous examples of successful women in traditionally ""male"" professions including astronauts, physicists, and surgeons. The reason why fewer gents succeed in highly complex job requires higher levels of intellect is likely because society tends to value traits associated with masculinity such as strength, confidence, aggression, and competitiveness over other qualities such as empathy, creativity, and leadership. However, although society values these characteristics, individuals do not necessarily possess these traits natively therefore limiting their options. For example, whilst strong men might excel at sports, they typically lack the soft skills required to coach young athletes effectively. Whilst women generally exhibit greater levels of empathy and softer skills, they are penalised for exhibiting these traits in traditional masculine environments.

They expect guys to read between the lines and interpret their messages correctly, whereas men typically prefer to get straight to the point. This results in fewer opportunities for romance to blossom since the lady initiates contact far less often than the guy. Additionally, ladies tend to put their friends/family first, thus putting their relationship second.

In summary, ladies need to start taking better care of themselves because ultimately, that is what attracts a man to you!","I believe this stems from the fact that most males prefer to date someone who shares similar values/lifestyle preferences to themselves. For example, let's assume a guy likes hiking, cooking, and traveling. If a lady enjoys these same hobbies, then there is a high likelihood that they will get along well with each other. However, if a lady prefers to watch Netflix and chill instead of going camping every weekend, then it's unlikely that they will click.

They typically exhibit traits associated with both sides of the spectrum, though they are neither entirely masculine nor feminine. For instance, although most fathers are physically strong, they are not overly aggressive or violent. On average, they are perceived as being slightly weaker than mothers, but again, this varies widely depending on individual preferences. Additionally, although most fathers are verbal communicators, they are not excessively talkative or verbose. In general, fathers are seen as possessing qualities of both extremes.","I believe mothers are typically more traditionalist and masculinized than fathers. This is because historically, mothers were responsible for protecting the family unit and ensuring the survival of the species. As such, they had to be tougher and stronger than other males competing for resources. Additionally, since most babies are dependent upon their mother until they reach adulthood, she must continue to take care of them and protect them throughout childhood. Thus, she was expected to exhibit traits associated with strength and toughness. On the other hand, dads were primarily responsible for raising the kids, thus they did not have to be as strong or aggressive as moms. In fact, they might even be seen as soft and feminine. However, over the past few decades, modern parenting styles have led to dads taking on more responsibilities and assuming greater levels of authority over their children. For instance, today dads are encouraged to participate in childrearing and play an active role in disciplining their children.

The reason for this difference is largely cultural.  In traditional societies, young adults generally leave home to start their lives independently.  This creates a sense of autonomy and independence among young adult males.  As a result, they are encouraged to pursue their passions and goals without relying on parental support.  On average, spinsters are therefore less likely to rely on family support during their younger years.  They are able to focus solely on themselves and develop strong personal skills necessary to succeed in adulthood.  By contrast, bachelor males are typically provided with greater financial resources, guidance, and emotional support throughout their childhoods.  These factors allow them to grow into confident, independent individuals.","I believe this comment was meant to apply specifically to girls raised by single mothers since most of the statistics regarding the impact of parental involvement shows that daughters whose parents were present during pregnancy had better outcomes.

Girls are generally more delicate than boys because they were born that way. However, the attire they wear plays a role in creating an impression in society. For instance, if a girl wears revealing clothing, it sends a message to other people that she is self-assured and wants to be seen. On the contrary, if a boy wears revealing clothing, it conveys to other people that he is confident and doesn't mind being perceived as conceited.","No, it is not just the attire they wear. The truth is that most boys grow up feeling like they are different from other kids. They get teased and picked on since early childhood. This leads to developing strategies to deal with stress and anxiety. One strategy is to avoid situations that cause stress and anxiety. Another strategy is to minimize contact with other human beings. In short, they learn to keep themselves busy so that they do not have to interact with humans. When parents start encouraging them to play sports, take part in extracurricular activities, go to parties, meet new friends, etc..., they end up missing school, college, jobs, and marriages.

Additionally, it is possible that they lack confidence given that they appear unwilling to express their opinions publicly. As a result, they remain stuck in their comfort zones and continue to pursue relationships that offer similar levels of stability and security.

This includes taking care of basic household chores, preparing meals, cleaning the house, picking up after themselves, etc. The reason why this happens is because couples grow old together, and thus learn to take turns doing certain tasks. Additionally, each person learns what works best for the other over time. For instance, my wife knows exactly how much laundry detergent to use, whereas I might forget to buy it every now and again.

For instance, a wife might start demanding housework from her husband because she feels undervalued. He, instead of understanding her feeling, starts treating her harshly.

First, it limits the amount of money available for education and job hunting, secondly, it creates additional stress for women who must now juggle household responsibilities alongside their primary role as wives and mothers, and thirdly, it perpetuates traditional gender stereotypes regarding the division of labor between the sexes.

This difference in communication style can cause women to interpret the behavior of their partner differently leading to frustration and confusion.","Spinsters typically lack confidence in themselves and therefore struggle to express their feelings and commit to a relationship.

For instance, let's assume a female singer named Jane Doe performs a cover version of Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way'. If Jane Doe were to receive acclaim for her performance, most fans of pop music might view her as a talented artist deserving of praise, regardless of genre. However, if Jane Doe covered Lady Gaga's song simply because she was asked to, and did so well, few viewers would associate her voice with pop culture. Instead, they'd likely see her as a great musician who happens to sing in the style of Lady Gaga. In contrast, if a male singer performed the exact same cover version, most fans of pop music would recognize his talent and appreciate his hard work, no matter the genre. Thus, although males and females perform covers versions of popular songs differently, overall, the reception received for each type of performance is largely based on individual merit. Unfortunately, this reality doesn't apply to pop music critics, who generally treat every female vocalist as though she were born to sing in the style of Lady Gaga, instead of","It seems likely that the reason males vocalists report feeling underappreciated is because they compare themselves to similarly talented females in the music business.

However, I disagree with the sentiment that housewives somehow manage to get away with doing anything else because they are women. In fact, I believe that the same logic applies to men who become stay-at-home dads. The reason why men generally pursue careers outside of parenting is because society expects them to contribute financially towards supporting the family unit, whereas women traditionally take on the role of primary bread winner. This expectation stems from the notion that men were created to compete against each other for resources, thus requiring financial support from their spouses. If a man becomes a stay-at-home dad, he is essentially giving up his right to participate in the labor market and competing against other men for scarce resources.

Additionally, it is possible to seek counseling to learn techniques to manage negative thoughts and behaviors.","It seems likely that you are referring to the fact that most men who get divorced end up feeling sad and alone because of the loss of their partner.  This is especially true since many men typically enter into marriages expecting to be romantically involved, and upon finding themselves unable to fulfill this role expect to see their partners become depressed.  However, it is worth noting that this isn't always the case.

She played a key role during the 1980s economic boom known as ""the winters of discontent"" leading the Conservative Party government. During her premiership, Thatcher introduced policies including devaluing the Pound against the US Dollar, increasing taxes on high income earners, reducing trade union rights, privatizing public services, ending price controls, introducing market mechanisms into education and healthcare, and cutting back on state intervention in the economy. These measures led to widespread strikes and protests throughout 1981–82, culminating in the Miners' Strike of 1984. Her actions were unpopular among large sections of the population, especially the lower paid, and contributed to the loss of support from traditional Labour voters in the 1983 general election. This resulted in her losing the leadership of the party to John Smith, and ultimately forced her resignation as prime minister. Following her departure from politics, Thatcher became a prominent businesswoman and philanthropist.","While it is certainly possible that Margaret Thatcher was not fully successful in achieving her leadership ambitions, this opinion seems to be based largely upon her role during the 1980s and 1990s, when she served as prime minister of Great Britain. During this period, she led her country through two difficult economic crises, known colloquially as ""the big bang"" and ""the panic of 1987,"" which were responsible for substantial public suffering and political instability. However, she oversaw major reforms to British trade policy, deregulated the financial sector, reduced income inequality, and introduced policies aimed at protecting the environment. In addition, she helped establish the European Union, which continues to serve as a model for liberal democratic governance today. Despite these achievements, critics argue that Thatcher failed to enact transformative change because of her authoritarian personality and lack of empathy.",-0.0202,-0.8272

They let them decide what to eat, wear, watch, read, listen to, talk about, and anything else that comes into their minds. They put up with everything instead of standing up for themselves. If they were truly independent women, they wouldn't have to put up with this type of treatment.","Widely recognized is a strong word here. There is no evidence to support the idea that husbands cause their wives' behaviors. In fact, most research indicates the exact opposite. The vast majority of psychologists agree that spouses influence each other far more strongly than they control or force each other. This is because humans naturally seek comfort from those closest to them, especially when feeling negative emotion. If a person feels lonely, depressed, anxious, or angry, they look to friends, family, and coworkers for guidance and advice. They ask themselves ""how am I affecting my loved ones?"" instead of simply thinking ""my spouse doesn't listen to me."" When someone tries to change a loved one, it creates stress and anxiety in the other person, leading to further resistance.

In fact, modern hunting practices have led to the demise of most large cat species throughout the world because males were typically responsible for hunting whereas females were left to raise families. This imbalance was necessary since males were larger and stronger and thus able to take down prey animals far bigger and stronger than themselves. However, over time, this imbalance caused females to become dependent upon humans for food, leading to human persecution. Fortunately, this trend is now reversing thanks to advances in technology allowing for the development of high powered rifles capable of taking down even the largest of game animals. As a result, today, there are once again numerous populations of wild lions living freely throughout Africa, Asia, and South America.","While it is generally accepted that larger cats are stronger and faster predators, recent scientific evidence suggests that size alone does not determine hunting prowess.

As adults, siblings typically share similar values, beliefs, opinions, and lifestyles. This closeness allows them to confide in each other, seek advice from each other, and offer support to each other. On average, sisters live longer than brothers, therefore they are able to impart wisdom into their brother's lives. Additionally, sisters generally take care of their younger siblings whereas brothers might not know much about parenting given that they themselves did not grow up with kids. Therefore, it is natural for brothers to rely heavily on their sister since they have someone else to lean on.","I believe it comes down to genetics. Brothers typically share 50/50 genes whereas sisters tend to inherit 50% more of each other's genes.

As a result, once a couple enters into their marriage, they assume that their partner will fill every role required to ensure that everything runs smoothly between the two of them. However, this assumption is rarely accurate since humans are complex beings who require different forms of stimulation in order to function properly.

They assume that since they're serving drinks and appetizers that they must know exactly what everyone wants and therefore overcharge for items.,"Waitresses often expect too much from customers during their dinners. This stems from the fact that most restaurants operate under a service economy instead of a retail model. In other words, unlike a store, restaurant owners do not set prices based on the cost of materials and labor required to produce goods/services provided to customers. Instead, they price their services according to the amount of money they believe they will earn over the course of a year via sales of food and beverages sold to customers. As a result, waitstaff must take into consideration not only the cost of preparing the meal itself, but also the additional costs associated with serving and cleaning up afterwards. If servers fail to anticipate customer demand levels accurately, they risk running short of supplies and incurring unnecessary waste management expenses. Additionally, because most diners order multiple courses, waiting staff must ensure each dish is properly plated and presented to avoid wasting ingredients. Finally, given that most meals consist of several side dishes, condiments, and drinks, servers must keep track of inventory levels and replenish items accordingly. All of these responsibilities add up quickly, especially considering that most restaurants are run by small teams whose workloads are already heavy.

They often appear aloof, detached, and unfriendly, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Additionally, because they are often childfree, they fail to develop strong emotional bonds with anyone else during their lifetimes, further contributing to feelings of emptiness and despair.","Ladies! Please stop reading my mind! The reason most bachelors appear to be heartless loners is because they rarely interact with other human beings. As a general rule, males are not great conversationalists, preferring instead to rely on non verbal communication via body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, and eye contact. This means that unless someone specifically invites them into conversation, they generally won't engage with anyone else. On top of this, since they're typically busy fulfilling their primary responsibilities of taking care of themselves and raising their families, they end up feeling isolated and alone. To combat this, ladies, it might be helpful to remember that although you may not see eye to eye with your partner on everything, you two share a common goal of building a family unit and creating a secure environment for yourselves and your offspring. Try reaching out to your partner and trying to strike up a conversation, even if it's just to tell them you've noticed they haven't said anything lately. If they refuse to talk to you, ask them why. Chances are they'll eventually open up to you. Once you get past the initial awkwardness, you might find you enjoy each other's company and start forming deeper connections.

This type of environment creates unrealistic expectations for the masseuse, leading them to believe that every woman they see is looking to sleep with them for money. Unfortunately, this mindset leads to subpar service because the masseuse isn't able to connect with the client on a deeper level, and therefore doesn't develop a strong therapeutic connection. Additionally, since the masseuse views themselves as entitled, they assume everyone else sees them the same way, and thus become frustrated when clients don't immediately fall into line with their idealized version of perfection.","It seems that most female masseuses view clients as objects to use and discard once their usefulness wanes. They see themselves as independent professionals who deserve respect and dignity. However, the reality is that they are simply looking for a quick buck and expect the client to foot the bill.

These changes reflect societal perceptions that cowgirls are no longer ""cowboys"" but instead females dressed up in male garb.","I believe cowboys are known for being strong and independent, especially when it comes to protecting their land and family.

Additionally, boys participate in sports and other extracurricular activities sooner than girls, leading them to miss developmental milestones associated with adulthood.

As a general rule, couples who remain committed to each other for longer periods of time demonstrate greater levels of emotional stability, competence, and affectional closeness than those who fail to maintain consistent contact. In particular, successful couples appear to share a number of core attributes including: high self-esteem, strong communication abilities, and a willingness to invest in their relationships. Unfortunately, few individuals grow into the capacity to effectively communicate complex thoughts, feelings, and desires over the course of years spent apart. This deficit tends to emerge during times of greatest stress, when individuals are least equipped to manage their emotions productively. For instance, recent research suggests that the tendency towards negative thinking known as rumination emerges as a result of experiencing acute distress upon receiving unexpected feedback. When faced with challenging circumstances, individuals typically attempt to avoid uncertainty by focusing intently on potential sources of harm. However, instead of attempting to identify realistic solutions to problems, they become consumed with obsessing over imagined threats to their sense of safety. The resulting cycle of negativity tends to lead to further anxiety and heightened sensitivity to perceived threat. Ultimately,","Spinsters typically lack confidence in themselves and/or their abilities to relate well to other human beings.

On average, spinsters live longer than bachelors because they devote more hours per day to pursuing their passions. However, spinsters must balance their commitments between family, friends, and personal interests, whereas bachelors tend to focus solely on their romantic partners. Thus, spinsters require additional time and energy to manage multiple priorities, which leads to increased free time.",0.7845,0.9781

Lastly, I believe that part of the reason why females generally don't seem to enjoy romantically relating with males is because they typically grow up in homes where moms and dads are absent, thus lacking examples of healthy father/son relationships.

For instance, they have to take care of guests' needs including serving food, taking guest's coats, opening doors for maids, cleaning up messes left behind by guests, among other things. These multi-tasking requirements require bellboy and bellgirl to focus on one task at a time instead of focusing on each individual task sequentially.

However, my personal opinion is that parents should encourage their sons to interact with other kids instead of banning them from doing so. In fact, I believe that boys learn more socially interacting with other kids vs. interacting with computers/video games since most boys were naturally born to be competitive and seek approval from peers over adults.

It sounds like you grew up in a loving home, but unfortunately abuse happens everywhere.  Unfortunately, kids growing up in households where adults treat each other poorly are likely to grow up experiencing mistreatment themselves.  This is especially true for kids whose parents were dating or involved in intimate relationships.  When someone abuses another person, it creates fear and uncertainty in the victim.  They're afraid of what might happen next, and uncertain about what will happen next.  As a result, victims of abuse often become fearful and anxious themselves.  They start thinking ""what if"" instead of ""now what.""  Instead of taking action now to address the situation, they get stuck in negative cycles of thought.  For instance, they worry that their partner will abuse again, and so they stay in the relationship hoping that something good will eventually happen.  In reality, staying in the relationship only perpetuates the cycle of fear and uncertainty.  If they leave, maybe they'll avoid getting hurt again.

Lastly, although it is possible for a governess to be overly strict, i do not believe this is inherent to the role. Rather, it is likely down to the personality of the individual parent and their expectations. For instance, if a parent hires a governess based on recommendations from friends/colleagues, then it is quite possible that these individuals described the parent as being demanding and strict. In contrast, if a parent hires a governess based on recommendation from friends/colleagues of similar ages to their own, then it is unlikely that the parent was seeking a strict disciplinarian.

As a result, they naturally assume that everyone else must therefore view them similarly. However, this assumption is incorrect since no matter whom they ask, nearly every person they talk to will attest that they are far worse suited for job interviews than single women. This is largely because unlike bachelors, single women know exactly what they want and how best to achieve it given their unique circumstances. For instance, let's imagine a single woman named Jane who recently graduated college with a degree in Computer Science. She now finds herself unemployed and looking for a new position. To land this next role, Jane knows she'll first need to convince potential employers that she is worth considering for the position. In order to do this, Jane will need to demonstrate that she possesses several key qualifications including 1) strong communication skills 2) excellent problem solving abilities 3) high levels of energy 4) a positive attitude 5) a sense of humor 6) a willingness to learn 7) a flexible schedule 8) the ability to multi-task 9) the desire to travel to multiple countries.","Spinsters often believe they are better suited for job interviews because they lack the confidence to apply for jobs traditionally associated with women, such as retail sales, customer service, and healthcare. However, this misconception stems from the fact that most spinsters were never taught how to present themselves during job interviews, nor did they grow up hearing stories of successful women applying for similar positions. As a result, spinsters typically end up failing interview after interview until they eventually give up and move back home with mommy.",0.9855,0.6597

However, stepmums should remember that they were once mothers themselves, and thus know firsthand the difficulties involved raising young kids alone. They should instead offer support and encouragement to his parenting efforts, and avoid criticizing or judging his decisions.","I'm not sure exactly what stepsiblings are, but my understanding is that most people refer to stepparents/stepchildren as ""stepsiblings"".  In other words, someone who has two parents, but also has stepchildren who were born via surrogate birth or conceived using artificial reproductive technology.  This person might call themselves a parent, but technically isn't because they didn't give birth to the child.  They're considered legal guardians until the age of 18 unless the court specifically says otherwise.  Stepsiblings typically live with both sets of grandparents growing up since each set of grandparents raised the child.  However, recently, laws have changed allowing steppsiblings to become primary caregivers once the stepper turns 18.  So now, instead of living with both sets of grandparents, they'll likely move into the home of the stepper.  The reason for this change is that courts believe that raising kids properly requires multiple sources of support.  If the stepper doesn't have biological siblings, they assume they must be ok with whatever arrangement was put in place.  But really, they're probably just trying to keep everyone happy!",0.4019,0.9326

In other words, no one should be forced into participating in something against their will.","I believe it is generally considered wrong to worship a male deity because gods in religions throughout history have traditionally been seen as representing the forces of creation and thus representational of womankind. Additionally, historically males were typically given greater power over females, therefore deities should reflect the balance between male and female characteristics. However, each individual must decide for themselves whether or not it is morally acceptable to worship a god based on their personal values.",0.4588,0.875

A recent study was able to determine this based on analyzing the brain scans of the horsemen during battle scenes. The results showed that the horsemen had similar patterns of neural activation to other characters in the game, including cowboys and ninjas. This indicates that the horsemen of asha share similarities with other popular fantasy roleplayers such as cowboys and ninjas.","The researchers analyzed data from over 1 million posts on Reddit between 2010 and 2015 and found that ""horsewomen"" were no more likely to post selfies of themselves holding guns nor were they more likely to brag about using firearms. In fact, they tended to downplay their gun use. The authors concluded that ""the stereotype of the hypersexualized, violent 'cowgirl' is largely unfounded.""",-0.2023,-0.8689
